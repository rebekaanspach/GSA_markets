The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement.

This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an onshore well, for oil or/and gas extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of onshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The drilling activity requires land for both work and disposal. While the work area can be held relatively small at around 0.2 ha, the disposal of drilling waste requires more space. Additional land is used for roads that need to be established as the wells are often located in remote areas. Here, a conversion of 90m2 per meter of drilling depth is expected, and with a 2-month construction period, the use of 15m2a/m.

This is the market for  'heat, district or industrial, natural gas', in the geography of Canada, Québec.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through the burning of natural gas in co-generation units, boilers and industrial furnaces. The dataset is targeted for district and industrial-scale heating. 
Geography:  As thermal heat is a product that can not be stored, a local market describes more accurately the reality. Quebec has been choosen as the best scale for the market as the fuels used for thermal heat in the industry are different between the canadian provinces according todata from StatCan.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.
