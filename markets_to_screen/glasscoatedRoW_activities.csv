Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for 'cement, unspecified', in the the geography of Europe without Switzerland. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.
No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.
The product ""cement, unspecified"" represents a weighted average of all types of cement in a generic market for cement.",cutoff-3.9.1,98dc82ae-f82b-52a2-b4fa-f22ac72cb1a4_ec23da1b-e5fa-4f01-bd2c-3233fece2175.spold,ec23da1b-e5fa-4f01-bd2c-3233fece2175,Europe without Switzerland,"market for cement, unspecified",[],1.0,"cement, unspecified",[],process,kilogram

In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.
This is the market for  'hazardous waste incineration facility', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a hazardous waste incineration facility. The facility has a yearly production of 20,000 tons waste and an expected lifetime 40 years. The process includes building infrastructure and demolition, land occupations and transformations.",cutoff-3.9.1,7147e9f4-c7a9-5ec1-891c-71c8c3b81a64_babbfb13-a047-4b0d-80ee-0fb67d0305a9.spold,babbfb13-a047-4b0d-80ee-0fb67d0305a9,GLO,market for hazardous waste incineration facility,[],1.0,hazardous waste incineration facility,[],process,unit

Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.
This is the market for  'waste mineral oil', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.
The waste mineral oil is treated in the same place as it is produced. That is why regional market activities are in this case adequate.
The same transport distances as in the global market are used.",cutoff-3.9.1,3cc7b300-3205-5751-8227-97a168ef9b68_1b30b018-ac39-41f4-a9e0-92057eef8bb8.spold,1b30b018-ac39-41f4-a9e0-92057eef8bb8,Europe without Switzerland,market for waste mineral oil,[],-1.0,waste mineral oil,[],process,kilogram
