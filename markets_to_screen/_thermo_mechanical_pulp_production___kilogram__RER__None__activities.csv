This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick.

The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Austria. The country-specific supply situation in 2019 was not available in EuroStat (2022), and the market mix hence remains the same as in Faist-Emmenegger et al. (2017). This activitiy contains information on energy and transport requirements (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This activitiy contains information on energy and transport requirements (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution from Faist-Emmenegger et al. (2017).
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of the United States of America. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

Although finer stones require more crushing energy than coarse ones, no distinction between gravel sizes was done, due to lack of detailed information. Crushed gravel is used as aggregate for construction, usually applied for concrete production or as a raw material in pavement subbase, for example as foundation material for highways, railways, runways, etc. Other major uses include aggregate for hot mix asphalt, and filler for highway, dam, and other back-filling. Smaller volumes of construction sand and gravel are used in plaster and gunite sands, snow and ice control, and railroad ballast.",cutoff-3.9.1,9887ac1d-deae-5b6a-9073-90bbc3e7a029_37eceabd-b33f-4757-a4b9-5c51dee1710d.spold,37eceabd-b33f-4757-a4b9-5c51dee1710d,RoW,"market for gravel, crushed",[],1.0,"gravel, crushed",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Greece. The country-specific supply situation in 2019 was modelled based on production and trade statisitcs from EuroStat (2022a,b). This activitiy contains information on energy and transport requirements (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution from Faist-Emmenegger et al. (2017).
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'clinker', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clinker"" represents Portland cement clinker, also known as cement clinker or just clinker. Crystallised calcium silicates that are rich in calcium oxide and can rapidly react with the mixing water make up at least two-thirds of the commercial portland cement clinker. The cement industry uses limestone, marl and clay for producing clinker. Therefore the raw material mixture is calcined in a rotary kiln. Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Poland. The country-specific supply situation in 2019 was modelled based on production and trade statisitcs from EuroStat (2022a,b). The share of domestic production was approximated by supply from Germany. This activitiy contains information on energy and transport requirements (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution from Faist-Emmenegger et al. (2017).
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'hot rolling, steel', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of the Netherlands. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an onshore well, for oil or/and gas extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of onshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The drilling activity requires land for both work and disposal. While the work area can be held relatively small at around 0.2 ha, the disposal of drilling waste requires more space. Additional land is used for roads that need to be established as the wells are often located in remote areas. Here, a conversion of 90m2 per meter of drilling depth is expected, and with a 2-month construction period, the use of 15m2a/m.
