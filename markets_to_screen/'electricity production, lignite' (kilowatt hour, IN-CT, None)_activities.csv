This dataset describes the electricity available on the high voltage level in India, Eastern grid. This is done by showing the transmission of 1kWh electricity at high voltage.
Technology:  Average technology used to transmit and distribute electricity. Includes underground and overhead lines, as well as air-, vacuum- and SF6-insulated high-to-medium voltage switching stations. Electricity production according to related technology datasets. 
Definition of the voltage levels: 
 - High voltage level above 24 kV (large scale industry)
 - Medium voltage level between 1 kV and 24 kV (medium to small scale industry, service sector
and public buildings)
 - Low voltage level below 1 kV (Households)

In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.
This is the market for  'lignite power plant', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a lignite power plant. The infrastructure represents the components of a coal power plant, based on two specific reference coal power plants with 100 MW and 500 MW. The dataset represents a mix with a share of 30 % and 70 %, respectively. The smaller power plants are equipped with electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and flue gas desulfurization plants (FGD), while an additional DeNOx plant was considered for the large power plants. This corresponds to lifetimes of 33 and 38 years, respectively. The area required is 2050 m2/MW. In addition, a construction period of 2 years is assumed. The process includes the materials necessary for the construction, construction efforts, land use as well as the decommission of all materials.",cutoff-3.9.1,e48b7854-f3e3-550b-b3dd-5e5dbc19f7d8_91fa7330-6eda-4832-a45f-9ab769c8c53a.spold,91fa7330-6eda-4832-a45f-9ab769c8c53a,GLO,market for lignite power plant,[],1.0,lignite power plant,[],process,unit
