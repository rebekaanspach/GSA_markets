This is the market for  'potato', in the Global geography.
In this market, default transport model and expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.
The default transport distances are built on a generic model which assigns the transport distances based on the ISIC code. This approach is, especially in case of fruits and vegetables, rather coarse. So in a certain cases expert judgement is used to adjust the default distances.
None
The transport distances and associated impacts presented in the markets represents the average scenario for given geography. In case of fruits and vegetables the final impact at the consumer vary a lot depending on whether the food is consumed near the producer or far. The average impact of, for example, banana is overestimated if the consumer is present in Brazil and it is heavily underestimated is the consumer is present in Europe. The markets are modelled so, that editing to model concrete scenario is possible and easy.
None
Fruits and vegetables are traded all over the world on an increasing scale.

Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

The shares of heat supplying activities from the different technologies have been estimated based on statistics from the federal government (BFE 2012) and IEA statistics (IEA 2013) for the year 2009.

This dataset represents the average transport of corrugated board boxes in the European market. Corrugated board boxes are commonly not traded globally but rather on regional/local markets. This datasets therefore represents the market for such boxes in Europe. Transport distances and modes were estimated. Losses are assumed negligible for this type of product.
Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for  'gypsum, mineral', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""gypsum, mineral"" represents the natural mineral CaSO4 * 2 H2O, milled. It is mined together with anhydrite rock in open pit mining. The output of the mine is crushed and sorted. The intermediate products are composed of about 65% natural gypsum (CaSO4 * 2 H2O), 34% natural anhydrite rock (CaSO4) and 1% soil and gravel that are deposited back in the mine. The material is gained by blasting and digging. Gypsum is used by the cement industry; as a filler in the paper industry, and as raw material for (burned) anhydrite and stucco.",cutoff-3.9.1,27db8381-d840-558b-8f76-38e30733f5c0_dd0cbafd-b176-4ba4-860a-25a2e0663d14.spold,dd0cbafd-b176-4ba4-860a-25a2e0663d14,RoW,"market for gypsum, mineral",[],1.0,"gypsum, mineral",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'heat, district or industrial, natural gas', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.
The shares of heat supplying activities from combined heat and power (CHP) plants and pure heat plants have been estimated based on OECD statistics (OECD (2013)) for the year 2009. They amount to about 70% heat from combined heat and power plants and 30% heat from pure heat plants. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future.
