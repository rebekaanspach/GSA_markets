This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of South Africa.
This dataset describes the average transport for the consumption of South African thermal coal, both for domestic consumption and for export. The market includes domestic coal sold on the open market (accounting for 37% of domestic coal sales, 26% of which are to Eskom for power generation), coal directly supplied to power stations via converyors from tied collieries (38% of domestic coal sales) and coal used by SASOL in their own operations for production of synthetic fuels and chemicals (22% of domestic coal sales). The remaining 3% of domestic sales is of metallurgical coal. The dataset also covers 35% of South Africa's coal exports (representing exports to countries other than India and Europe, as these are covered by their own market datasets). As such this market process is comprised of 87% domestic sales and 13% export sales and accounts for the sale of 210 million tonnes in 2014 (domestic and export sales extracted from DMR (2015a).

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''calcium nitrate'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Global. 
If 1 kg of this 'calcium nitrate' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.171 kg of Nitrogen as N.

'Calcium nitrate' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 10124-37-5. It is called 'calcium dinitrate' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: Ca1N2O6. It is solid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, 'calcium nitrate' is used in the following products: anti-freeze products, fertilisers, cosmetics and personal care products, washing & cleaning products, water treatment chemicals, adhesives and sealants, pH regulators and water treatment products, coating products, metal surface treatment products, non-metal-surface treatment products and metal working fluids. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: mining, building & construction work and agriculture, forestry and fishing. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (17-0-0) +0.24 Ca.

The activity represents transport of hard coal, run of mine to various users in the country. Average Transport distance specific for the country has been used. Handling and Transit Losses has been used in the dataset.   
The major modes of transport of coal in India are Railways, Road (use of lorries), Merry Go Round Systems (MGR), Belt or Pipe Conveyor. The majority of the coal transportation is handled by Railways which contributes to almost 52 % of the overall coal transport in india. Coal transported through road is around 26 % while merry go round system contributes around 18.48 %. Belt conveyor contributes to around 1.55 % of overall transportation.In this activity Railaway and MGR are combined into one because of their similar systems.
The transport distance for the datasets are calculated by using online maps by finding approximate distance between dispatch points and users. The quantity of coal being despatched from each mine to various users was published by Coal India Limited in their online app "" Coal Sewa"".

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick. If the average compression strength is 3 45 MPa, the brick is ranked as extra strong. The main product of the Swiss industry is brick. It is usually plastered. If it is used for a visible brick wall aesthetic criteria as colour and structure of the surface have to be fulfilled and a good weathering resistance is necessary.",cutoff-3.9.1,10282993-ad4b-5b68-a2bc-7afe8f7b5023_e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad.spold,e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad,GLO,market for clay brick,[],1.0,clay brick,[],process,kilogram

The resultant coatings have excellent chemical resistance, good mechanical properties, and no effects on taste (adding or taking away taste from packaged foods or drinks). The vast majority of the food and beverage cans produced in theworld today are coated internally with epoxy–formaldehyde resin coatings.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport (distribution) to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Global.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.
