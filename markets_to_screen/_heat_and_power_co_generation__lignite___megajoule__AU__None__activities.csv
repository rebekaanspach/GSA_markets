This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a lignite power plant. The infrastructure represents the components of a coal power plant, based on two specific reference coal power plants with 100 MW and 500 MW. The dataset represents a mix with a share of 30 % and 70 %, respectively. The smaller power plants are equipped with electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and flue gas desulfurization plants (FGD), while an additional DeNOx plant was considered for the large power plants. This corresponds to lifetimes of 33 and 38 years, respectively. The area required is 2050 m2/MW. In addition, a construction period of 2 years is assumed.

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of China.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in China. In China coal is transported mainly by railway (60%), water (30%), and road (10%).
