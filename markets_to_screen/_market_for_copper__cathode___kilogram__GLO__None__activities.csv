This dataset represents the average transport of corrugated board boxes. Corrugated board boxes are commonly not traded globally but rather on regional/local markets. This datasets was therefore introduced for the supply of regions which lack local production and markets of corrugated board boxes. Transport distances and modes were estimated based on the ecoinvent default transport assumptions. The estimated amount of transport via transoceanic ship was neglected, because intercontinental trade is not common for this type of product. Losses are assumed negligible for this type of product.
Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

This dataset represents the global market for glued laminated timber (glulam).
Glued laminated timber, also called glulam, is a type of structural engineered wood product comprising a number of layers of dimenstional sawn timber bonded together with durable, moisture-resistant structural adhesives. 
By laminating a number of smaller pieces of sawn timber, a single large, strong, structural member is manufactured from smaller pieces. These structural members are used as vertical columns or horizontal beams (standard forms), as well as curved, arched shapes (special forms). Glulam is readily produced in curved shapes and is available in a range of species and appearance characteristics to meet varied end-use requirements. Connections are usually made with bolts or plain steel dowels and steel plates.
Glulam is distinct from Cross Laminated Timber (CLT), for which layers of sawn timber are glued in perpendicular orientation to adjacent layers.

Cement mortar can be used indoor as well as outdoor. It is suitable for walling, plastering and mend-ing of parts. It is also used to make socles and walls underground or for plastering areas which have to be highly shock-resistant. The differences between mortar and plaster lie in the capacity of plasters to take better finish, which depend to a very large extent on the type of sand used in the mix. For mortar we use coarse particles of sand.",cutoff-3.9.1,3951c4eb-ec78-5a89-a89f-1a546b701f49_d454e221-5f08-4259-b46b-31d0dbe595d1.spold,d454e221-5f08-4259-b46b-31d0dbe595d1,CH,market for cement mortar,[],1.0,cement mortar,[],process,kilogram

This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''urea'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Global. 
If 1 kg of this 'urea' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.466 kg of Nitrogen as N.
The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Urea' is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 57-13-6. It is called 'urea' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CH4N2O. It is solid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, 'urea' is used in the following products: fertilisers, cosmetics and personal care products and pH regulators and water treatment products. This substance has an industrial use resulting in manufacture of another substance (use of intermediates). On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, pulp, paper and paper products, textile, leather or fur and mineral products (e.g. plasters, cement). Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (47-0-0).

They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''ammonium sulfate'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Global. 
If 1 kg of this 'ammonium sulfate' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.212 kg of Nitrogen as N.
The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Ammonium sulfate' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 7783-20-2. It is called 'ammonium sulfate' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H8N2O4S. It is solid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, 'ammonium sulfate' is used in the following products: fertilisers and plant protection products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, textile, leather or fur, pulp, paper and paper products, plastic products and fabricated metal products. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (21-0-0) +0.24 S.

This market represents the clinker for cement in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point (cement factories). Transport distance was estimated by defining the non integrated cement plants in Brazil and identifying the closest clinker source, based on public information and expert opinion, while for integrated plants, transportation distance was set to zero. 24 out of 88 cement production plants in Brazil were assumed to be non integrated. The average transportation distance of these plants is 500 km, but high uncertainty is associated with it. The resulting average transportation distance considering integrated and non-integrated cement plants is 136 km.
We also assumed the same modal distribution for clinker as for cement distribution.Imports of clinker are negligible in Brazil according to the National Union of the Cement Industry.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Italy. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Colombia. Imports to the market for natural gas in Colombia have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.
This is the market for  'hydropower plant, run-of-river', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a hydropower plant, run-of-river. The lifetime of the structural part is assumed to be 80 years, while for the remaining parts the lifetime is 40 years. Run-of-river power plants are hydro power plants without important reservoirs. Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset.  The technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency of 82%. The process includes all materials necessary to construct it, electricity and water consumption during manufacturing and decommission.

This is the market for  'quicklime, in pieces, loose', in the geography of Switzerland.
Based on research in the Swiss statistics (Swiss Impex database -> www.swiss-impex.admin.ch) majority of building and construction materials produced in Switzerland are also consumed in Switzerland, that is why the regional market for quicklime, in pieces, loose is created.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime.

This is the market for  'limestone, crushed, washed', in the Global geography.
In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.
The product ""limestone, crushed, washed"" represents 1 kg of washed crushed limestone. 	Limestone is a naturally occurring mineral that consists principally of calcium carbonate but may also contain magnesium carbonate as a secondary component. It is found in many forms and is classified in terms of its origin, chemical composition, structure, and geological formation. Limestone occurs widely throughout the world and is an essential raw material for many industries. Limestone is generally used for construction, cement, quicklime, agriculture, metal refining and flue gas desulphurisation: Construction: Limestone is the most widely used crushed rock, although it is generally sold in form of sand and gravel. Cement: The production of cement is the main use for chalk, and a major use for dense, high-calcium limestone. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime. Agriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of limestone. Metal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag. Flue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of limestone is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.",cutoff-3.9.1,cb5d87d0-5e83-5b15-8fd9-ef696a77a371_64cea105-f89a-4f95-ae44-84ff904a28fc.spold,64cea105-f89a-4f95-ae44-84ff904a28fc,RoW,"market for limestone, crushed, washed",[],1.0,"limestone, crushed, washed",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas', in the geography of Canada, Québec.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through various other means than natural gas. This includes burning of biomethane in gas turbine; biogas in co-gen gas engine; anthracite, coal, lignite briquettes and coke in stove; hardwood, logs, softwood, wood chips, wood pellets in furnaces and wood heaters; light fuel oil in boilers. Also contributing are heat from heat pumps and solar collectors. The dataset is targeted for district and industrial-scale heating. 
Geography:  As thermal heat is a product that can not be stored, a local market describes more accurately the reality. Quebec has been choosen as the best scale for the market as the fuels used for thermal heat in the industry are different between the canadian provinces according todata from StatCan.

They also account for transport (distribution) to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Canada. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'hot rolling, steel', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Brazil. This dataset describes the energy requirements and the emissions of the high pressure distribution network in Brazil. Total network losses are extrapolated from the ‘market for natural gas, high pressure’ dataset for the Norwegian region, valid for the year of 2012, available in database version 3.6.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This is the market for  'fatty acid methyl ester', in the geography of Brazil.
This dataset represents the distribution phase of the Brazilian average mix of vegetable oils and animal fats methyl ester. From the esterification plant, the product is transported to fuel distribution points, where biodiesel may be blended with fossil diesel.
Data obtained under the scope of the National Biofuel Policy (RenovaBio), implemented in 2017 by the Brazilian Federal Government seeking to expand the share of biofuels in the energy mix. On its framework, biofuels producers are subjected to a certification process, which requires Life Cycle Inventory data collection used to calculate the environmental efficiency (climate change category) of its product. The calculations are executed in the RenovaCalc calculator, which defines the system boundaries and contains many predefined indicators to connect with the collected data. Until the present study, 19 biodiesel producers have been certified and their LCI data are used in this dataset for describing the esterification process.
The RenovaCalc calculator, accounts for the distribution phase of biodiesel by using predefined distances based on official and sector data according to the transport mode reported by the producer. The weighted average data reported by the producers reveals that the distribution of biodiesel is done 92% by road transport and 8% by railway. For biodiesel, RenovaCalc considers a distance of 1,500 km (for railway modal, it is considered 900 km by train and 600 by road).
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in: redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database/.

This inventory is based on the BR regional market of refined petroleum product dataset available in ecoinvent version 3.6 (2019), which was created as a copy (with adjusted uncertainty information) of the corresponding datasets for Europe without Switzerland in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017) within the SRI-LCI data collection projects. The original dataset for regional distribution of refined petroleum products was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2, and it was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.
This dataset comprises transportation of product from the refinery to the end-user, operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents. To update with primary data, only the transportation of diesel to the end-user is adapted. For this, it is considered the location of refineries; the amount of diesel imported in each port; the amount and location of diesel deliveries in 78 primary distribution points; and, the amount of diesel sold in each Brazilian city. 
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database 
Geography:  Weighted average distance (ton.km) per transport mode for delivering diesel from production and importing points to the end-user were estimated for the Brazilian market. The operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents were extrapolated from the RER region (surveys mainly for DE and CH).
Technology:  None
Time period:  Distribution distances were estimated for the year of 2018.

The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

They also account for transport (distribution) to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Nigeria. Imports to the market for natural gas in Nigeria have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff. Because US data do not allow separate inventories for the distinct types an unspecified containerboard was introduced.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''potassium nitrate'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Global. 
If 1 kg of this 'potassium nitrate' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.139 kg of Nitrogen as N and 0.466 kg of Potassium as K2O.
The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Potassium nitrate' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 7757-79-1. It is called 'potassium nitrate' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: KNO3. It is solid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, 'potassium nitrate' is used in the following products: fertilisers, cosmetics and personal care products, anti-freeze products and washing & cleaning products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: formulation of mixtures and/or re-packaging, agriculture, forestry and fishing and scientific research and development.

This dataset represents the refined diesel mix (standard grade) traded and consumed within South Africa. Refined (standard grade) diesel comes from two main sources: crude oil refinery operations in ZA and from imports. A small amount is also exported. Data from SAPIA (South Africa Petroleum Industry Association) report 2016.
South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). The major petroleum products that are sold in South Africa are petrol, diesel, jet fuel, illuminating paraffin, fuel oil, bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), with petrol and diesel as the major liquid fuels that are used in South Africa.
There are six major liquid fuel producing sites in the country - four on the coast and two inland (Fig 1: Source: SAPIA annual report 2016) and refined petroleum products are produced by crude oil refining, by coal-to-liquid (CtL) and gas-to-liquid (GtL) technologies and by natural gas to liquid fuels.
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
""PETROL and DIESEL PRODUCTS SPECIFICATIONS: The current fuel specifications and standards published by DoE are suited to meet Euro 2 fuel standards (Clean Fuels 1). 
Fuels specification and standards are regulated by to the Petroleum Product Act 1977 (Act No. 120 of 1977) revised and updated on 23 June 2006. Petrol permitted grades are: metal-free unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95; metal-containing unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95 and maximum permitted traces of lead of 13 milligrams per litre; petrol with more than 95 RON; petrol with lead additives for use in airplanes with internal combustion engines. Diesel permitted grades are: standard grade diesel (max sulphur content of 500 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v), low-sulphur diesel (max sulphur content of 50 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v); biodiesel 100%.

Geography:  South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very little oil and gas. Liquid fuels, of which about 1/3rd are made synthetically from coal and gas, play a central role in the socio-economic development of the country. 
None
The oil industry is divided into upstream, midstream and downstream activities. Upstream refers to the exploration and production of crude oil. Midstream refers to refining, whilst downstream includes transportation and marketing of end-user products. South Africa has very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). 
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
INDUSTRY ROLE PLAYERS: The major role players in the South African liquid fuels market are government and its associated institutions, as well as SAPIA members. The DoE is responsible for ensuring the secure and sustainable provision of energy for socio-economic development. Through institutions like the CEF and NERSA, the government plays a significant role in the South African liquid fuels market.
MARKET PRICES: Government regulates wholesale margins and controls the retail price of petrol. South African petroleum prices are regulated, based on import parity price formulas. This means that the domestic price is influenced by supply and demand for petroleum products in international markets, combined with the rand/dollar exchange rate

The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This dataset represents the global market for uncoated particle board. Particleboard, or particle board (or chipboard in the UK and Commonwealth Nations such as Australia, New Zealand and others), is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, saw-mill shavings, or saw dust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Particleboard is a composite material according to the standard EN 312. The density of stan-dard particleboard can vary between 650 – 750 kg/m3, whereas densities for low density particle-board can be as low as 250 kg/m3 and range up to 1300 kg/m3 for high density particleboard. Typical thickness is in a range of 3 to > 40 mm. Uncoated particle board represent the weighted average of particle boards produced by the members of the European Panel Federation (EPF).
Seven types of boards are classified and are distinguished as follows (EN 312):P1 General purpose boards for use in dry conditions, P2 Boards for interior fitments (including furniture) for use in dry conditions, P3 Non load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P4 Load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P5 Load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P6 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P7 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions. Particleboard is mainly used in furniture manufacturing. 
Particleboard can also be used for structural applications. Different types of speciality boards can be produced according to individual building application requirements; moisture resistance, fire retardance or acoustic insulation are all properties which can be achieved by using specific types of particleboard. Particleboard can also be used for construction purposes in combination with other materials, for example in parquet or insulation materials.

It consits of data coming from five different companies, each one consisting of several mining sites for an overall coverage of 74,8% of ZA PGMs production for the year of reference (2015). 
[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: Most of the mining and concentration operations for PGM are in an area called Bushveld Complex. The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals.
The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments.
The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone.
The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance. 
The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium.
The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium. The complex  has its geographic centre  located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs).
Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen.
After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes.
In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots.
At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.

PLATINUM MINIG IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex.
The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output.
Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value.
In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies.
The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

This dataset describes the energy requirements and the emissions of the high pressure distribution network in Japan. This module describes the transport of natural gas from the evaporation plant to the customer. The calculation of the emissions is based on the composition of the natural gas and the yearly losses.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'limestone, crushed, for mill', in the Global geography.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""limestone, crushed, for mill"" represents a naturally occurring mineral that consists principally of calcium carbonate but may also contain magnesium carbonate as a secondary component. It is found in many forms and is classified in terms of its origin, chemical composition, structure, and geological formation. Limestone occurs widely throughout the world and is an essential raw material for many industries. Limestone is generally used for construction, cement, quicklime, agriculture, metal refining and flue gas desulphurisation: Construction: Limestone is the most widely used crushed rock, although it is generally sold in form of sand and gravel. Cement: The production of cement is the main use for chalk, and a major use for dense, high-calcium limestone. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime. Agriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of limestone. Metal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag. Flue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of limestone is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.",cutoff-3.9.1,02cc2f48-7a34-5ffd-b499-26b3fb19f379_6dff6412-4b37-4689-8187-f07be186feef.spold,6dff6412-4b37-4689-8187-f07be186feef,RoW,"market for limestone, crushed, for mill",[],1.0,"limestone, crushed, for mill",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick. If the average compression strength is 3 45 MPa, the brick is ranked as extra strong. The main product of the Swiss industry is brick. It is usually plastered. If it is used for a visible brick wall aesthetic criteria as colour and structure of the surface have to be fulfilled and a good weathering resistance is necessary.",cutoff-3.9.1,10282993-ad4b-5b68-a2bc-7afe8f7b5023_e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad.spold,e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad,GLO,market for clay brick,[],1.0,clay brick,[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'potato', in the Global geography.
In this market, default transport model and expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.
The default transport distances are built on a generic model which assigns the transport distances based on the ISIC code. This approach is, especially in case of fruits and vegetables, rather coarse. So in a certain cases expert judgement is used to adjust the default distances.
None
The transport distances and associated impacts presented in the markets represents the average scenario for given geography. In case of fruits and vegetables the final impact at the consumer vary a lot depending on whether the food is consumed near the producer or far. The average impact of, for example, banana is overestimated if the consumer is present in Brazil and it is heavily underestimated is the consumer is present in Europe. The markets are modelled so, that editing to model concrete scenario is possible and easy.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Russian Federation. Imports to the market for natural gas in Russian Federation have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This dataset represents the refined diesel mix (low-sulfur) traded and consumed within South Africa (ZA). Refined low-sulfur diesel comes from three main sources: crude oil refinery operations in ZA, from syntethic fuel production in ZA and from imports. A small amount is also exported. Data from SAPIA (South Africa Petroleum Industry Association) report 2016.
South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). The major petroleum products that are sold in South Africa are petrol, diesel, jet fuel, illuminating paraffin, fuel oil, bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), with petrol and diesel as the major liquid fuels that are used in South Africa.
There are six major liquid fuel producing sites in the country - four on the coast and two inland (Fig 1: Source: SAPIA annual report 2016) and refined petroleum products are produced by crude oil refining, by coal-to-liquid (CtL) and gas-to-liquid (GtL) technologies and by natural gas to liquid fuels.
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
""PETROL and DIESEL PRODUCTS SPECIFICATIONS: The current fuel specifications and standards published by DoE are suited to meet Euro 2 fuel standards (Clean Fuels 1). 
Fuels specification and standards are regulated by to the Petroleum Product Act 1977 (Act No. 120 of 1977) revised and updated on 23 June 2006. Petrol permitted grades are: metal-free unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95; metal-containing unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95 and maximum permitted traces of lead of 13 milligrams per litre; petrol with more than 95 RON; petrol with lead additives for use in airplanes with internal combustion engines. Diesel permitted grades are: standard grade diesel (max sulphur content of 500 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v), low-sulphur diesel (max sulphur content of 50 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v); biodiesel 100%.

Geography:  South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very little oil and gas. Liquid fuels, of which about 1/3rd are made synthetically from coal and gas, play a central role in the socio-economic development of the country. The oil industry is divided into upstream, midstream and downstream activities. Upstream refers to the exploration and production of crude oil. Midstream refers to refining, whilst downstream includes transportation and marketing of end-user products. South Africa has very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). 
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
INDUSTRY ROLE PLAYERS: The major role players in the South African liquid fuels market are government and its associated institutions, as well as SAPIA members. The DoE is responsible for ensuring the secure and sustainable provision of energy for socio-economic development. Through institutions like the CEF and NERSA, the government plays a significant role in the South African liquid fuels market.
MARKET PRICES: Government regulates wholesale margins and controls the retail price of petrol. South African petroleum prices are regulated, based on import parity price formulas. This means that the domestic price is influenced by supply and demand for petroleum products in international markets, combined with the rand/dollar exchange rate

Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime.

The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6. Crude oil directly imported to the Swiss refinery in Cressier is transported through the Pipeline Oléoduc du Jura Neuchâtelois from the port Fos-sur-Mer close to Marseille in France (Erdöl-Vereinigung 2017). The length of the Pipeline is estimated to 600 km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

The transport requirements correspond to the information provided in the GLO market activity.
The product ""lime"" represents 1 kg of quicklime. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime. Agriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of lime. Metal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag. Flue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of lime is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Algeria. Imports to the market for natural gas in Algeria have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This dataset represents 1m3 of 30MPa ready-mix concrete, exposure classes XC3/XD2/XF1/XA1 (typically referred to as B2 in Austria) and XC3 (typically referred to as B1 in Austria) delivered at the construction site. 30 MPa concrete is intended for building structures in general, exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses. Transport distances were based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007. Uncertainty was adjusted accordingly. Refer to the Global transport model available in the support section of the ecoinvent website (https://www.ecoinvent.org/home.html).
Geography:  Austrian data. Due to its characteristics, ready-mix concrete is only traded locally.
Technology:  Unspecified lorry was considered as a proxy to represent Austrian fleet technology
