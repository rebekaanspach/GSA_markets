(2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

The product ""cement, alternative constituents 6-20%"" represents cement (CEM II/A), also known as Portland-limestone cement or Portland composite cement. It covers the representative production mix of CEM II/A-D, CEM II/A-LL and CEM II/A-S according to EN 197-1. This product is made of clinker and 6-20% alternative constituents (weight-%). Alternative constituents may include limestone, granulated blast furnace slag, silica sand (max. 10%), pozzolan, flue ash or burned slate. Portland composite cement is used for the production of concrete.
Geography:  Due to low price, big weight and consumers distribution cement is not traded globally.
