Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.
