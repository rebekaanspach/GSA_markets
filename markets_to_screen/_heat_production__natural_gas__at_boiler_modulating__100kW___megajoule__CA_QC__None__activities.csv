The product ""clinker"" represents Portland cement clinker, also known as cement clinker or just clinker. Crystallised calcium silicates that are rich in calcium oxide and can rapidly react with the mixing water make up at least two-thirds of the commercial portland cement clinker. The cement industry uses limestone, marl and clay for producing clinker. Therefore the raw material mixture is calcined in a rotary kiln. Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime.",cutoff-3.9.1,14f5286e-08c4-5e66-a395-259bd004379d_1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538.spold,1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538,RoW,market for clinker,[],1.0,clinker,[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'hot rolling, steel', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

The activity ""diesel, burned in diesel-electric generating set, 10MW, for oil and gas extraction"" represents the use of a fossil fuel. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from distillation of heavy oil. This exchange provides the service of burning 1 MJ of diesel diesel-electric generator. The services also includes (air) emissions and the production and provision of fuel. Following the approach of Meili et al. (2022), region-specific emission data for the overall production of crude oil and natural gas are considered for CH4, NOx and SO2 (as described in chapters 9.2 and 9.5 in Meili et al., 2022). Emissions of CH4, NOx, and SO2 are consequently omitted from the inventory of ""diesel, burned in diesel-electric generating set, 10MW, for oil and gas extraction"" to avoid double-counting. 1 MJ equals 0.0234 kg of diesel (LHV of diesel ca 42.8 MJ/kg).

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of China.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in China. In China coal is transported mainly by railway (60%), water (30%), and road (10%). Two major transport corridors are distinguished: the North–south coal traffic accounting for 75% and the east–west coal traffic accounting for 25% of the total coal transported (Wang and Ducruet, 2014).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.
Geography:  Transport distances are geography specific, losses and related emissions are generic values applicable worldwide.

This is the market for  'onshore well, oil/gas', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an onshore well, for oil or/and gas extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of onshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The drilling activity requires land for both work and disposal. While the work area can be held relatively small at around 0.2 ha, the disposal of drilling waste requires more space. Additional land is used for roads that need to be established as the wells are often located in remote areas. Here, a conversion of 90m2 per meter of drilling depth is expected, and with a 2-month construction period, the use of 15m2a/m. The process includes all energy uses, materials and emissions for drilling of an offshore bore hole and finishing of the well.
