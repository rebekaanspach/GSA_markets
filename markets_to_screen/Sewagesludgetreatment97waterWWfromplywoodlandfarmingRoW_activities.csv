[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]

This is the market for  'liquid manure spreading, by vacuum tanker', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is delivering the service of 'liquid manure spreading, by vacuum tanker' of 1 m3. It includes use of mobile infrastructure (tractors, machinery) operating with diesel. Diesel consumption is the most crucial parameter within this service as it lineraly affects direct emissions generated through diesel combustion. Hence, a user can model the right amount of this service by using information on diesel consumption. For example: If within the user's model diesel consumption is 0.2 kg of diesel per m3 while in this service it is 0.1 kg/m3, the user can model with 2 m3 of this service.",cutoff-3.9.1,0c6a5a1f-5441-5708-9c7c-05426b56fd96_a2193d6a-1c79-42de-aa16-355543601b4e.spold,a2193d6a-1c79-42de-aa16-355543601b4e,GLO,"market for liquid manure spreading, by vacuum tanker",[],1.0,"liquid manure spreading, by vacuum tanker",[],process,cubic meter
