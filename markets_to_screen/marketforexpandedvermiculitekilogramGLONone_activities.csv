Application areas include: loose filling for hollow spaces, e.g., cavity walls; production of insulating plaster by bonding with gypsum or cement ; cement-bonded material is also used to prevent condensation on ceilings and walls in rooms with moist atmospheres; waterglass-bonded slabs for covering load-bearing constructional units made of steel or concrete, and for providing a fireproof covering; as an additive to produce lightweight aggregate concrete, in competition with porous and pumice-stone concrete.",cutoff-3.9.1,3c0ef743-1358-5502-bed6-2567f16bb014_3f667976-b486-4a60-a9ce-ab972e437fe3.spold,3f667976-b486-4a60-a9ce-ab972e437fe3,GLO,market for expanded vermiculite,[],1.0,expanded vermiculite,[],process,kilogram

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Global.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.
