This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a nuclear spent fuel reprocessing facility. Reprocessing of spent fuel elements offers the possibility of recovering and recycling valuable fissile materials (U-235 and Pu-239). The utilization of the fissile material contained in the fuel elements takes place in the reprocessing plant by separating the quantitatively small portion (approx. 4%) of radioactive fission products from the main component uranium (approx. 95%) and the usable plutonium (approx. 1%). This is followed by several extraction steps to purify the uranium and plutonium from fission and activation products and unwanted actinides. The THORP plant (BNFL, Sellafield, UK) and its adjoint facilities (for vitrification and conditioning of waste from light water reactors) have been used as main reference for the estimation of the infrastructure, although for the operation most of the data are for UP2 and UP3 plants (Cogema, La Hague, FR).

This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a nuclear waste storage, final repository for high level radioactive waste. The infrastructure consists of a 5 km long ramp that leads to the approximately 650 m deep and 120 m thick host rock, suitable for approximately 16,000 m3 of waste like conditioned spent fuel (SF), vitrified high level waste (HLW) and intermediate level waste (ILW) repository. The area required for the external facilities of the portal area amounts to a maximum of 300 m Ã 150 m and is divided into two parts (50:50 split of 22500 m2 each): on the one hand, the administration building, operating building, ventilation building, equipment lock, railroad access road, road access road and, on the other hand, the conditioning and packaging facility (NTB 02-02) - covered in separate modules. A further area take-up originates from the facilities in the shaft head area in the emplacement operation (construction stage 3) and is estimated at 100 m Ã 100 m (10000 m2), including winding tower with exhaust vents, site office, crew rooms, workshop, transformer station, excavated material depot and equipment/materials hall. Thus, the total area conversion of the repository is approximately 32500 m2 (22500+10000). Of this, 80% (18000+8000=26000 m2) is assumed to be built-up, 20% (4500+2000=6500 m2) is assumed to be grassland. The first part of the area is used over a period of 23 years (8 years of construction and 15 years of operation), the second part during 15 years (operation only). This gives a value of 5.34E+5 m2a for industrial land use and 1.34E+5 m2a for green space. The total demand for buildings is 1.3E+5 m3.

This is the market for crude âpetroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This inventory is based on the BR regional market of refined petroleum product dataset available in ecoinvent version 3.6 (2019), which was created as a copy (with adjusted uncertainty information) of the corresponding datasets for Europe without Switzerland in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017) within the SRI-LCI data collection projects. The original dataset for regional distribution of refined petroleum products was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2, and it was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.
This dataset comprises transportation of product from the refinery to the end-user, operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents. To update with primary data, only the transportation of diesel to the end-user is adapted. For this, it is considered the location of refineries; the amount of diesel imported in each port; the amount and location of diesel deliveries in 78 primary distribution points; and, the amount of diesel sold in each Brazilian city. 
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database 
Geography:  Weighted average distance (ton.km) per transport mode for delivering diesel from production and importing points to the end-user were estimated for the Brazilian market.

This dataset describes the energy requirements and the emissions of the high pressure distribution network in Japan. This module describes the transport of natural gas from the evaporation plant to the customer. The calculation of the emissions is based on the composition of the natural gas and the yearly losses.
The product ânatural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15Â°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the worldâs third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the countryâs production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the âhard coal, import from RUâ datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ânatural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15Â°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'hot rolling, steel', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000Â° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 Ã 30 Ã 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components.
