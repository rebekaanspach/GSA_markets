Market groups represent a 'market of markets'. Their purpose is to group a set of markets into larger, geographically relevant datasets.
Market groups are created for convenience and ease of use. They only group other markets and/or market groups contained within their geography.
Losses and relevant exchanges (transport, transport infrastructure, etc.) are not included in this dataset. They are present in the contained markets.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This dataset describes the electricity available on the high voltage level in Germany. This is done by showing the transmission of 1kWh electricity at high voltage.
Technology:  Average technology used to transmit and distribute electricity. Includes underground and overhead lines, as well as air-, vacuum- and SF6-insulated high-to-medium voltage switching stations. Electricity production according to related technology datasets. 
Definition of the voltage levels: 
 - High voltage level above 24 kV (large scale industry)
 - Medium voltage level between 1 kV and 24 kV (medium to small scale industry, service sector
and public buildings)
 - Low voltage level below 1 kV (Households)
Time period:  The 'Start of Period' and 'End of Period' do not refer to the year for which this market is valid.
