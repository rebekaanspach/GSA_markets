This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Canada. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

The glass sheet is heated to a temperature just below its softening point (about 640°C, thermal tempering) and then immediately cooled by special jets of cold-air. These harden the surface of the glass, giving the inside more time to cool.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Italy. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick. If the average compression strength is 3 45 MPa, the brick is ranked as extra strong. The main product of the Swiss industry is brick. It is usually plastered. If it is used for a visible brick wall aesthetic criteria as colour and structure of the surface have to be fulfilled and a good weathering resistance is necessary.",cutoff-3.9.1,10282993-ad4b-5b68-a2bc-7afe8f7b5023_e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad.spold,e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad,GLO,market for clay brick,[],1.0,clay brick,[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'containerboard, fluting medium', in the Global geography.
Fluting medium id commonly not traded globally but rather on regional/local markets. This datasets was therefore introduced for the supply of regions which lack local production and markets of corrugated board boxes. Transport distances and modes were estimated based on the ecoinvent default transport assumptions. The estimated amount of transport via transoceanic ship was neglected, because intercontinental trade is not common for this type of product. Losses are assumed negligible for this type of product.
Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

(2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This dataset represents the average transport of corrugated board boxes in the European market. Corrugated board boxes are commonly not traded globally but rather on regional/local markets. This datasets therefore represents the market for such boxes in Europe. Transport distances and modes were estimated. Losses are assumed negligible for this type of product.
Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

This is the market for  'hot rolling, steel', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an onshore well, for oil or/and gas extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of onshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The drilling activity requires land for both work and disposal. While the work area can be held relatively small at around 0.2 ha, the disposal of drilling waste requires more space. Additional land is used for roads that need to be established as the wells are often located in remote areas. Here, a conversion of 90m2 per meter of drilling depth is expected, and with a 2-month construction period, the use of 15m2a/m.

""containerboard, unspecified"" in the US consists of an average mix of kraftliner (50.7%), 100% recycled linerboard (16.1%), semichemical corrugating medium (18.8%) and 100% recycled corrugating medium (14.4%). 
The ecoinvent ""containerboard production, unspecified"" in the US therefore corresponds to an average of ""containerboard production, kraftliner"", ""containerboard production, testliner"", ""containerboard production, semichemical fluting"", ""containerboard production, recycled fluting"" in other geographies.
Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff. Because US data do not allow separate inventories for the distinct types an unspecified containerboard was introduced.

This dataset represents the transport of linerboard from the mill to corrugated board box production sites. Linerboard id commonly not traded globally but rather on regional/local markets. This datasets was therefore introduced for the supply of regions which lack local production and markets of corrugated board boxes. Transport distances and modes were estimated based on the ecoinvent default transport assumptions. The estimated amount of transport via transoceanic ship was neglected, because intercontinental trade is not common for this type of product. Losses are assumed negligible for this type of product.
Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

This dataset represents the average transport of corrugated board boxes. Corrugated board boxes are commonly not traded globally but rather on regional/local markets. This datasets was therefore introduced for the supply of regions which lack local production and markets of corrugated board boxes. Transport distances and modes were estimated based on the ecoinvent default transport assumptions. The estimated amount of transport via transoceanic ship was neglected, because intercontinental trade is not common for this type of product. Losses are assumed negligible for this type of product.
Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

This dataset describes the energy requirements and the emissions of the high pressure distribution network in Japan. This module describes the transport of natural gas from the evaporation plant to the customer. The calculation of the emissions is based on the composition of the natural gas and the yearly losses.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Algeria. Imports to the market for natural gas in Algeria have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

The product is used in the following applications and sectors: Poly(vinyl fluoride) films are laminated to sheets of metal with special adhesives. The laminates are used for exterior siding on industrial and residential buildings. Pigmented films can be made in any colour .  These films made from PVF have exceptional resistance to sunlight, chemical attack, and water adsorption. They are also extremely tough and have good abrasion resistance. Films can also be laminated to hardboard, paper, polystyrene, polyurethane, and other substrates. These laminates are used for wall coverings, aircraft cabin interiors, pipe covering, duct liners, as well as other applications. A weather-resistant PVF barrier is also resistant to abrasion, chemicals, solvents, and staining. Another application for PVF film is as a release sheeting in the molding of phenolic, epoxide, and polyester plastics, and as a release film for bag molding. It does not become brittle and strips easily from the mold. Toughness is maintained at elevated temperatures at all degrees of humidity and in contact with common solvents. The film has been used for photovoltaic applications because of its high transparency and resistance to solar radiation.",cutoff-3.9.1,13185c4b-ee9f-536c-b9a4-6fb678a576d4_6534b875-82f0-4714-b31e-58214929b0a9.spold,6534b875-82f0-4714-b31e-58214929b0a9,GLO,"market for polyvinylfluoride, film",[],1.0,"polyvinylfluoride, film",[],process,kilogram
