This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This dataset represents the global market for uncoated particle board. Particleboard, or particle board (or chipboard in the UK and Commonwealth Nations such as Australia, New Zealand and others), is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, saw-mill shavings, or saw dust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Particleboard is a composite material according to the standard EN 312. The density of stan-dard particleboard can vary between 650 – 750 kg/m3, whereas densities for low density particle-board can be as low as 250 kg/m3 and range up to 1300 kg/m3 for high density particleboard. Typical thickness is in a range of 3 to > 40 mm. Uncoated particle board represent the weighted average of particle boards produced by the members of the European Panel Federation (EPF).
Seven types of boards are classified and are distinguished as follows (EN 312):P1 General purpose boards for use in dry conditions, P2 Boards for interior fitments (including furniture) for use in dry conditions, P3 Non load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P4 Load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P5 Load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P6 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P7 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions. Particleboard is mainly used in furniture manufacturing. 
Particleboard can also be used for structural applications. Different types of speciality boards can be produced according to individual building application requirements; moisture resistance, fire retardance or acoustic insulation are all properties which can be achieved by using specific types of particleboard. Particleboard can also be used for construction purposes in combination with other materials, for example in parquet or insulation materials.

This is the market for  'sulfite pulp, bleached', in the Global geography.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product “sulfite pulp” is a type of bleached, chemical, wood-containing pulp. It represents Total Chlorine Free (TCF) and Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulp. Chemical pulp is produced by chemical pulping of biomass raw materials, most commonly hardwood and softwood, or also straw from many cereals, bagasse, reed, or esparto grass, and from other annual non-wood plants. The sulfite process is based on calcium, magnesium, and sodium or ammonium bisulfide and produces pulp which is virtually pure cellulose. As the process occurs in acidic conditions one of its drawbacks is that some of the cellulose is hydrolysed, making the sulfite pulp fibres not as strong as other pulps, for example, those obtained with the sulfate process (i.e. kraft pulp). Nonetheless, and although globally the sulfate process is used in up to 90% of chemical pulping processes, sulfite pulps are important for specialty papers (e.g. tissue, glassine) and as a sources of cellulose for various applications within or out of the paper industry.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Region of North America.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This dataset represents the global market for medium density fibreboard (MDF). MDF is an engineered wood product according to the standard EN 622-5 with a density typically between 500 kg/m3 and 1000 kg/m3. Standard boards are available in Europe with thicknesses in the range of 1.8 to 60 mm. Standard MDF is being used for the manufacture of table tops, door panels and drawer fronts with moulded edges or profiled surfaces. The smooth and stable surfaces of MDF provide an excellent substrate for painting or the application of decorative foils or wood veneers. The inherent stability, good machinability and high strength of MDF creates opportunities for it to be used as an alternative to solid wood for applications such as drawer sides, cabinet rails, mirror surrounds and mouldings. Although primarily developed for use in furniture, standard MDF is being used increasingly for shop fitments, exhibition displays, wall panelling, architectural mouldings and many other applications where its good machining and finishing characteristics are used to advantage. MDF product types are available for the use in more demanding situations like for moisture resistant, flame retardant, high density and exterior grades of MDF. Moisture resistant boards are being used for bathroom fitments, doors, window boards and other interior building applications where resistance to damp conditions or intermittent wetting are important requirements. Flame retardant boards are being used increasingly for fitted furniture, doors and panelling in public buildings and other areas which have to conform to national fire regulations.

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick.

It consits of data coming from five different companies, each one consisting of several mining sites for an overall coverage of 79,3% of ZA gold production for the year of reference (2015). Shares between treatment of sulfidic tailing and gold mining and unrefined gold production are: 6.3% (recovered from retreatment) and 73% (produced from mining operation).
The refinement of gold takes place at Rand Refinery (Pty) Limited that is the largest integrated single-site preciuos metal refining and smelting complex in the world. Rand Refinery is the refining hub for Africa and increasingly beyond.

Transport is either via road (predominantly in South Africa) or via air and sea freight. Share of the different tecnologies were taken from the ecoivent transport template (2013/07/22).
Most of the mining operation and unrefined gold production activities are in an area called Witwatersrand basin. The are is approximately 350 km long and 200 km wide. the gold mines in this area are possiblu the deepest in the world (mining operation at 3600 m  and explortion core-drilling up to 4600 m. Peak gold production occurred in 1970 when over 1000 metinc tonnes were mined.

This is the market for  'rosin size, for paper production', in the Global geography.
In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.
The product “rosin size, for paper production” is a sizing agent used in the paper industry. Sizing agents are used for improving the paper resistance to aqueous liquids. Rosin size is produced by treating rosin with an alkali. Rosin is a residue derived from the distillation and subsequent removal of volatile materials (notably turpentine) of the gum of pines. Rosin is insoluble in water and therefore is treated by saponification with caustic soda or soda ash. For paper production, aluminium sulphate is usually added to the rosin which leads to the precipitation of the size (Roberts, M. T., and Etherington D. (1998))",cutoff-3.9.1,9bf416ca-32aa-53f3-99de-41dd3fdd11fc_0793f6d6-802f-40de-9a18-1f6bc0f351e5.spold,0793f6d6-802f-40de-9a18-1f6bc0f351e5,RoW,"market for rosin size, for paper production",[],1.0,"rosin size, for paper production",[],process,kilogram

This inventory is based on the BR regional market of refined petroleum product dataset available in ecoinvent version 3.6 (2019), which was created as a copy (with adjusted uncertainty information) of the corresponding datasets for Europe without Switzerland in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017) within the SRI-LCI data collection projects. The original dataset for regional distribution of refined petroleum products was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2, and it was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.
This dataset comprises transportation of product from the refinery to the end-user, operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents. To update with primary data, only the transportation of diesel to the end-user is adapted. For this, it is considered the location of refineries; the amount of diesel imported in each port; the amount and location of diesel deliveries in 78 primary distribution points; and, the amount of diesel sold in each Brazilian city. 
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database 
Geography:  Weighted average distance (ton.km) per transport mode for delivering diesel from production and importing points to the end-user were estimated for the Brazilian market. The operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents were extrapolated from the RER region (surveys mainly for DE and CH).

This is the market for 'granulated blast furnace slag', in the geography of Brazil.

In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).
This is a constrained market for GBFS, which is further grinded and added to cement as a clinker replacement. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange.
Transport distance was measured from all the 32 steelmaking factories associated to the Brazilian Steel Institute to the 56 cement making factories associated to the Brazilian Portland cement Association that actually manufacture slag cement. The underlying assumption was that cement making factories bought granulated blast furnace slag from the closest steelmaking factory (this was confirmed by sector experts). The average distance is 159.22 km, but high uncertainty is associated with it.
Lorry's size was defined as 16-32t based on the average amount of granulated blast furnace slag generated in the country and transported daily. Considering the number of investigated steelmaking factories, around 640 ton of GBFS leave each factory, every day, which would require a lorry able to transport elevated loads.
EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent 45% of Brazilian road cargo fleet, according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.

The product ""granulated blast furnace slag"" represents  the intermediate treatment of raw blast furnace slag, producing an output of granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS). GBFS resembles a natural sand grain, with a more angular form. It has a glass content of over 95% and presents excellent hydraulic properties. The GBFS usually goes through a subsequent grinding process, generating a supplementary cementitious material called ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS).

This market represents the clinker for cement in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point (cement factories). Transport distance was estimated by defining the non integrated cement plants in Brazil and identifying the closest clinker source, based on public information and expert opinion, while for integrated plants, transportation distance was set to zero. 24 out of 88 cement production plants in Brazil were assumed to be non integrated. The average transportation distance of these plants is 500 km, but high uncertainty is associated with it. The resulting average transportation distance considering integrated and non-integrated cement plants is 136 km.
We also assumed the same modal distribution for clinker as for cement distribution.Imports of clinker are negligible in Brazil according to the National Union of the Cement Industry.

This is the market for  'fatty acid methyl ester', in the geography of Brazil.
This dataset represents the distribution phase of the Brazilian average mix of vegetable oils and animal fats methyl ester. From the esterification plant, the product is transported to fuel distribution points, where biodiesel may be blended with fossil diesel.
Data obtained under the scope of the National Biofuel Policy (RenovaBio), implemented in 2017 by the Brazilian Federal Government seeking to expand the share of biofuels in the energy mix. On its framework, biofuels producers are subjected to a certification process, which requires Life Cycle Inventory data collection used to calculate the environmental efficiency (climate change category) of its product. The calculations are executed in the RenovaCalc calculator, which defines the system boundaries and contains many predefined indicators to connect with the collected data. Until the present study, 19 biodiesel producers have been certified and their LCI data are used in this dataset for describing the esterification process.
The RenovaCalc calculator, accounts for the distribution phase of biodiesel by using predefined distances based on official and sector data according to the transport mode reported by the producer. The weighted average data reported by the producers reveals that the distribution of biodiesel is done 92% by road transport and 8% by railway. For biodiesel, RenovaCalc considers a distance of 1,500 km (for railway modal, it is considered 900 km by train and 600 by road).
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in: redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database/.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of China. Besides domestic production, China imported large quanties of natural gas from other countries (mainly from Australia and Turkmenistan) in 2019 (BP 2022). The supply to this market activity, however, only includes domestic production.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is the market for  'quicklime, in pieces, loose', in the Global geography.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime.

This dataset represents the European market for uncoated particle board. Particleboard, or particle board (or chipboard in the UK and Commonwealth Nations such as Australia, New Zealand and others), is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, saw-mill shavings, or saw dust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Particleboard is a composite material according to the standard EN 312. The density of stan-dard particleboard can vary between 650 – 750 kg/m3, whereas densities for low density particle-board can be as low as 250 kg/m3 and range up to 1300 kg/m3 for high density particleboard. Typical thickness is in a range of 3 to > 40 mm. Uncoated particle board represent the weighted average of particle boards produced by the members of the European Panel Federation (EPF). Seven types of boards are classified and are distinguished as follows (EN 312):P1 General purpose boards for use in dry conditions, P2 Boards for interior fitments (including furniture) for use in dry conditions, P3 Non load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P4 Load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P5 Load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P6 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P7 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions. Particleboard is mainly used in furniture manufacturing. Particleboard can also be used for structural applications. Different types of speciality boards can be produced according to individual building application requirements; moisture resistance, fire retardance or acoustic insulation are all properties which can be achieved by using specific types of particleboard. Particleboard can also be used for construction purposes in combination with other materials, for example in parquet or insulation materials.
