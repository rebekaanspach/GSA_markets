This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Region of North America.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

The product ""clinker"" represents Portland cement clinker, also known as cement clinker or just clinker. Crystallised calcium silicates that are rich in calcium oxide and can rapidly react with the mixing water make up at least two-thirds of the commercial portland cement clinker. The cement industry uses limestone, marl and clay for producing clinker. Therefore the raw material mixture is calcined in a rotary kiln. Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime.",cutoff-3.9.1,14f5286e-08c4-5e66-a395-259bd004379d_1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538.spold,1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538,RoW,market for clinker,[],1.0,clinker,[],process,kilogram
