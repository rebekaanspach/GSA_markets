This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of the United States of America. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of China. Besides domestic production, China imported large quanties of natural gas from other countries (mainly from Australia and Turkmenistan) in 2019 (BP 2022). The supply to this market activity, however, only includes domestic production.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Northern America.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in North America (US and Canada). All inland transportation modes are used for coal shipments in this region. In the US, which is the dominating coal market in North America, about 70% of coal is transported by rail, about 10% by barges on inland waterways, 10% by truck and 10% by conveyor belts to reach its destination of use or exporting ports (Association of American Railroads, 2017). Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage are estimated based on literature.

This dataset represents the global market for bleached sulfate market pulp. Tranports are modelled with the ecoinvent default transport model.
PULP is a clean, wood-based, renewable and biodegradable raw material to make different paper, board and other products. Depending on its application, bleached or unbleached pulp is required. Here, Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleached kraft pulp
 are covered. 
It is further distinguished between integrated pulp, which is further processed into pulp based products such as papers within the same production site, and market pulp which is internationally traded. Therefore only market pulp is covered in this dataset.

The activity represents transport of hard coal, run of mine to various users in the country. Average Transport distance specific for the country has been used. Handling and Transit Losses has been used in the dataset.   
The major modes of transport of coal in India are Railways, Road (use of lorries), Merry Go Round Systems (MGR), Belt or Pipe Conveyor. The majority of the coal transportation is handled by Railways which contributes to almost 52 % of the overall coal transport in india. Coal transported through road is around 26 % while merry go round system contributes around 18.48 %. Belt conveyor contributes to around 1.55 % of overall transportation.In this activity Railaway and MGR are combined into one because of their similar systems.
The transport distance for the datasets are calculated by using online maps by finding approximate distance between dispatch points and users. The quantity of coal being despatched from each mine to various users was published by Coal India Limited in their online app "" Coal Sewa"".

Coal transported through road is around 26 % while merry go round system contributes around 18.48 %. Belt conveyor contributes to around 1.55 % of overall transportation
lignite' is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 8.8 MJ/kg. It is used as a solid fuel and is sourced from lignite mines. Its main applications are in the following sectors: domestic heating and agriculture.
Geography:  Average distance calculated between mines and their dispacth location.
Technology:  All the major lignite producing companies in india have their own thermal power plants in india. The lignite is transported from these mines to the respective coal based power plants through belt conveyors.

 Depending on its application, bleached or unbleached pulp is required. The here covered unbleached kraft pulp is commonly used in liner for corrugated board, wrappings, sack and bag papers, envelopes and other unbleached specialty papers.
It is further distinguished between integrated pulp, which is further processed into pulp based products such as papers within the same production site, and market pulp which is internationally traded. Therefore only market pulp is covered in this dataset.
CAPACITIES
The world’s total market pulp capacity is ca 64 million tons. The Western European capacity for market pulp is ca. 13 million tons. The Latin American eucalyptus pulp capacity is ca. 22 million tons. (2018)

This dataset describes the energy requirements and the emissions of the high pressure distribution network in Japan. This module describes the transport of natural gas from the evaporation plant to the customer. The calculation of the emissions is based on the composition of the natural gas and the yearly losses.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement.

This is the market for  'rosin size, for paper production', in the Global geography.
In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.
The product “rosin size, for paper production” is a sizing agent used in the paper industry. Sizing agents are used for improving the paper resistance to aqueous liquids. Rosin size is produced by treating rosin with an alkali. Rosin is a residue derived from the distillation and subsequent removal of volatile materials (notably turpentine) of the gum of pines. Rosin is insoluble in water and therefore is treated by saponification with caustic soda or soda ash. For paper production, aluminium sulphate is usually added to the rosin which leads to the precipitation of the size (Roberts, M. T., and Etherington D. (1998))",cutoff-3.9.1,9bf416ca-32aa-53f3-99de-41dd3fdd11fc_0793f6d6-802f-40de-9a18-1f6bc0f351e5.spold,0793f6d6-802f-40de-9a18-1f6bc0f351e5,RoW,"market for rosin size, for paper production",[],1.0,"rosin size, for paper production",[],process,kilogram

The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.
