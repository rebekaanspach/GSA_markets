This is the market for  'gravel, crushed', in the geography of India.
This dataset describes transportation of processed gravels to the consumers site. In India gravel were transported to end users by road within radius of 200 km from production facility due to economical reasons. 
The product ""gravel, crushed"" represents crushed stone from open granite or basalt quarries. Although finer stones require more crushing energy than coarse ones, no distinction between gravel sizes was done, due to lack of detailed information. Crushed gravel is used as aggregate for construction, usually applied for concrete production or as a raw material in pavement subbase, for example as foundation material for highways, railways, runways, etc. Other major uses include aggregate for hot mix asphalt, and filler for highway, dam, and other back-filling. Smaller volumes of construction sand and gravel are used in plaster and gunite sands, snow and ice control, and railroad ballast.

The major modes of transport of coal in India are Railways, Road (use of lorries), Merry Go Round Systems (MGR), Belt or Pipe Conveyor. The majority of the coal transportation is handled by Railways which contributes to almost 52 % of the overall coal transport in india. Coal transported through road is around 26 % while merry go round system contributes around 18.48 %. Belt conveyor contributes to around 1.55 % of overall transportation.In this activity Railaway and MGR are combined into one because of their similar systems.
The transport distance for the datasets are calculated by using online maps by finding approximate distance between dispatch points and users. The quantity of coal being despatched from each mine to various users was published by Coal India Limited in their online app "" Coal Sewa"".

(a) By designing the concrete mix: such concrete shall be called ‘Design mix concrete’, for details reference may be made to RCC Chapter.
(b) By adopting nominal concrete mix: such concrete shall be called ‘Nominal mix concrete’.
None
Design mix concrete is preferred to nominal mix. If design mix concrete cannot be used for any reason on the work for grades of M20 or lower, nominal mixes may be used with the permission of Engineer-in-Charge, which, however, is likely to involve a higher cement content.
