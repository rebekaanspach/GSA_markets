This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Switzerland. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6. Crude oil directly imported to the Swiss refinery in Cressier is transported through the Pipeline Oléoduc du Jura Neuchâtelois from the port Fos-sur-Mer close to Marseille in France (Erdöl-Vereinigung 2017). The length of the Pipeline is estimated to 600 km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 7697-37-2. It is called 'nitric acid' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: HNO3. It is liquid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, 'nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state' is used in the following products:  washing & cleaning products, fertilisers, polishes and waxes and air care products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: pH regulators and water treatment products, washing & cleaning products, non-metal-surface treatment products, metal surface treatment products, water treatment chemicals, semiconductors and laboratory chemicals. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (22-0-0).

This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''ammonium nitrate'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Europe. 
If 1 kg of this 'ammonium nitrate' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.35 kg of Nitrogen as N.
The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Ammonium nitrate' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 6484-52-2. It is called 'ammomium nitrate' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H4N2O3. It is solid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, 'ammonium nitrate' is used in the following products: fertilisers, explosives and adhesives and sealants. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, wood and wood products, plastic products, fabricated metal products and food products. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (35-0-0).
