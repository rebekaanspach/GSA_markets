This is a generic market that provides 'inorganic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5' for a strictly agricultural use as fertiliser. The market combines (consumption mix) various inorganic sources for the nutrient provided for the given geography. Data for the consumption of this nutrient originate from the International Fertiliser Association.

No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.
Fertilisers are substances that furnish essential nutrients for plant growth, thereby improving the yield and in some cases the quality of plant products. 'Inorganic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5' is a fertiliser with a mineral origin that is supplying the nutrient of Phosphorus to the plants. The product represents an equivalent form of Phosphorus that is present in the fertiliser and is expressed as a mass of Phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5). 'Inorganic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5'  can  originate from various substances that are synthesised using fossil resources. Those substances can be, phosphoric acid, beneficiated phosphate rock etc, while the fossil resources can be phosphate rock.
