Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for  'steel, low-alloyed', in the Global geography.
Transport distances are based on the ecoinvent ""Default Transport Assumptions"" model, accessible on the ecoinvent website.
Geography:  Activity represents the supply of iron ore concentrate globally.",cutoff-3.9.1,46d1e548-981c-5bb2-8821-55fee9f66320_817c3650-4fed-4ef2-b9b6-404a198834e6.spold,817c3650-4fed-4ef2-b9b6-404a198834e6,GLO,"market for steel, low-alloyed",[],1.0,"steel, low-alloyed",[],process,kilogram
