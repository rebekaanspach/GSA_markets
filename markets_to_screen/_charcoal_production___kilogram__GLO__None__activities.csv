This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of China.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in China. In China coal is transported mainly by railway (60%), water (30%), and road (10%). Two major transport corridors are distinguished: the North–south coal traffic accounting for 75% and the east–west coal traffic accounting for 25% of the total coal transported (Wang and Ducruet, 2014).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.
Geography:  Transport distances are geography specific, losses and related emissions are generic values applicable worldwide.
Technology:  Not specified",cutoff-3.9.1,7f6ec89c-a6e9-5632-a963-3a22cf2eb66a_0d3eda5a-4601-4573-9549-0701c459ab88.spold,0d3eda5a-4601-4573-9549-0701c459ab88,CN,market for hard coal,[],1.0,hard coal,[],process,kilogram
