This market dataset models the disposal mix for 1 kg of municipal solid waste in France using country-specific data. The mix is composed by the following technologies: 0% of open burning, 38% of sanitary landfill, 62% of municipal incineration. Values are rounded without decimals. If a technology is listed, it participates in the technology mix. The transport from the production site of the waste to the different treatment facilities where the waste is treated is accounted here. Collection of the waste is included in the transport estimate, reflecting transport distances from eurostat. There are no losses considered in the dataset.

It is assumed that most of the waste produced in Switzerland is also treated in Switzerland, that is why a regional Swiss market is created for the treatment of average incineration residue.
