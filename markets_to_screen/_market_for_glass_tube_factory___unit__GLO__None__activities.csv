Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement.

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick. If the average compression strength is 3 45 MPa, the brick is ranked as extra strong. The main product of the Swiss industry is brick. It is usually plastered. If it is used for a visible brick wall aesthetic criteria as colour and structure of the surface have to be fulfilled and a good weathering resistance is necessary.",cutoff-3.9.1,10282993-ad4b-5b68-a2bc-7afe8f7b5023_e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad.spold,e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad,GLO,market for clay brick,[],1.0,clay brick,[],process,kilogram
