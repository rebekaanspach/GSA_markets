This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Global. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area.

This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''ammonia, anhydrous, liquid'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, China. 
If 1 kg of this 'ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.822 kg of Nitrogen as N.
The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 7664-41-7. It is called 'ammonia' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H3N. It is gaseous in normal conditions of temperature and pressure and has a distinct pungent odor. On a consumer level, 'ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is used in the following products: cosmetics and personal care products, heat transfer fluids, washing & cleaning products and coating products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, textile, leather or fur, pulp, paper and paper products, plastic products and fabricated metal products. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (82-0-0).
