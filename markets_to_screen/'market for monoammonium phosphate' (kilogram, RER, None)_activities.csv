Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of ethylene, pipeline system from activities that produce it within the geography RER.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site. Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.",cutoff-3.9.1,ea810d9a-cd5d-5722-8ba2-54fe3acbc96a_c7c790e7-474f-495a-911e-bb905050682d.spold,c7c790e7-474f-495a-911e-bb905050682d,RER,"market for ethylene, pipeline system",[],1.0,"ethylene, pipeline system",[],process,kilogram

Market groups represent a 'market of markets'. Their purpose is to group a set of markets into larger, geographically relevant datasets.
Market groups are created for convenience and ease of use. They only group other markets and/or market groups contained within their geography.
Losses and relevant exchanges (transport, transport infrastructure, etc.) are not included in this dataset. They are present in the contained markets.  
This is the market group for 'municipal solid waste', in Europe.",cutoff-3.9.1,9ad5c2cc-fe61-5a53-bbb9-776d98ac382b_27da8130-82ba-485c-a800-b89efdcb0491.spold,27da8130-82ba-485c-a800-b89efdcb0491,RER,market group for municipal solid waste,[],-1.0,municipal solid waste,[],process,kilogram

In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.
This is the market for  'hazardous waste, for incineration', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.
The hazardous waste, for incineration is treated in the same place as it is produced. That is why regional market activities are in this case adequate.
