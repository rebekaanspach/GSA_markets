Industrially, this product is mostly used in 30% solution state. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: for the production of chlorides, for refining ore in the production of tin and tantalum, for pickling and cleaning of metal products, in electroplating, in removing scale from boilers, for the neutralization of basic systems, as a laboratory reagent, as a catalyst and solvent in organic syntheses, in the manufacture of fertilizers and dyes, for hydrolyzing starch and proteins in the preparation of various food products, and in the photographic, textile, and rubber industries. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.",cutoff-3.9.1,128aebdb-14c9-5237-823c-f79142341b35_3ab60559-40d3-42e4-9cac-476a519098fa.spold,3ab60559-40d3-42e4-9cac-476a519098fa,RoW,"market for hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state",[],1.0,"hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state",[],process,kilogram

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This dataset describes the electricity available on the high voltage level in State Grid North China Branch. This is done by showing the transmission of 1kWh electricity at high voltage.
Technology:  Average technology used to transmit and distribute electricity. Includes underground and overhead lines. Electricity production according to related  technology datasets.
Definition of the voltage levels: 
 - High voltage level above 24 kV (large scale industry)
 - Medium voltage level between 1 kV and 24 kV (medium to small scale industry, service sector
and public buildings)
 - Low voltage level below 1 kV (Households)
