Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is the market for  'heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas', in the geography of Canada, Québec.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through various other means than natural gas. This includes burning of biomethane in gas turbine; biogas in co-gen gas engine; anthracite, coal, lignite briquettes and coke in stove; hardwood, logs, softwood, wood chips, wood pellets in furnaces and wood heaters; light fuel oil in boilers. Also contributing are heat from heat pumps and solar collectors. The dataset is targeted for district and industrial-scale heating. 
Geography:  As thermal heat is a product that can not be stored, a local market describes more accurately the reality. Quebec has been choosen as the best scale for the market as the fuels used for thermal heat in the industry are different between the canadian provinces according todata from StatCan.

Time period:  The shares of heat supplying activities from the different technologies are based on statistics from the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks for the year 2009. They amount to about 58% heat from natural gas, 27% heat from heavy fuel oil, 8% heat from coal, 4% from coke and 2% from others (light fuel oil, propane) ...
