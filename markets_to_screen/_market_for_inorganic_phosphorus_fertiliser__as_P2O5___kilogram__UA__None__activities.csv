(2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is a generic market that provides 'inorganic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5' for a strictly agricultural use as fertiliser. The market combines (consumption mix) various inorganic sources for the nutrient provided for the given geography. Data for the consumption of this nutrient originate from the International Fertiliser Association.

No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.
Fertilisers are substances that furnish essential nutrients for plant growth, thereby improving the yield and in some cases the quality of plant products. 'Inorganic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5' is a fertiliser with a mineral origin that is supplying the nutrient of Phosphorus to the plants. The product represents an equivalent form of Phosphorus that is present in the fertiliser and is expressed as a mass of Phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5). 'Inorganic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5'  can  originate from various substances that are synthesised using fossil resources. Those substances can be, phosphoric acid, beneficiated phosphate rock etc, while the fossil resources can be phosphate rock.
