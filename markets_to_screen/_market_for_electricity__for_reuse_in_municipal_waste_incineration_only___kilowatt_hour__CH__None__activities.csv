The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 7664-41-7. It is called 'ammonia' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H3N. It is gaseous in normal conditions of temperature and pressure and has a distinct pungent odor. On a consumer level, 'ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is used in the following products: cosmetics and personal care products, heat transfer fluids, washing & cleaning products and coating products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, textile, leather or fur, pulp, paper and paper products, plastic products and fabricated metal products. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (82-0-0).

The product ""cement, alternative constituents 6-20%"" represents cement (CEM II/A), also known as Portland-limestone cement or Portland composite cement. It covers the representative production mix of CEM II/A-D, CEM II/A-LL and CEM II/A-S according to EN 197-1. This product is made of clinker and 6-20% alternative constituents (weight-%). Alternative constituents may include limestone, granulated blast furnace slag, silica sand (max. 10%), pozzolan, flue ash or burned slate. Portland composite cement is used for the production of concrete.
