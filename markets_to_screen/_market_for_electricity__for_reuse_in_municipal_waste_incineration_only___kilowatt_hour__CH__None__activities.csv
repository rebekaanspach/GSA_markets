The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 7664-41-7. It is called 'ammonia' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H3N. It is gaseous in normal conditions of temperature and pressure and has a distinct pungent odor. On a consumer level, 'ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is used in the following products: cosmetics and personal care products, heat transfer fluids, washing & cleaning products and coating products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, textile, leather or fur, pulp, paper and paper products, plastic products and fabricated metal products. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (82-0-0).

The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).
The product ""cement, alternative constituents 6-20%"" represents cement (CEM II/A), also known as Portland-limestone cement or Portland composite cement. It covers the representative production mix of CEM II/A-D, CEM II/A-LL and CEM II/A-S according to EN 197-1. This product is made of clinker and 6-20% alternative constituents (weight-%). Alternative constituents may include limestone, granulated blast furnace slag, silica sand (max. 10%), pozzolan, flue ash or burned slate. Portland composite cement is used for the production of concrete.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, low pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Switzerland. 
The consumption mix is supplied (after pressure reduction) by the corresponding market activity for natural gas at high pressure. 
The product ‘natural gas, low pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas.
