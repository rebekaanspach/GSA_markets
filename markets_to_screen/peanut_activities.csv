This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

The production volume is set equal to that of the supplying transforming activity. It is calculated based on data from the IEA, according to which the current ""global energy demand for the chemical industry is 15 EJ per year (EJ/yr) excluding feedstock"" (IEA, 2013). Roughly 40% of the energy is assumed to be delivered in the form of steam, based on data for the United States (JISEA, 2016). Furthermore, the production volume of the dataset covering the geography of Europe (RER) has been subtracted, in order to account only for the production of steam occurring in the rest of the world.

The original dataset for regional distribution of refined petroleum products was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2, and it was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.
This dataset comprises transportation of product from the refinery to the end-user, operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents. To update with primary data, only the transportation of diesel to the end-user is adapted. For this, it is considered the location of refineries; the amount of diesel imported in each port; the amount and location of diesel deliveries in 78 primary distribution points; and, the amount of diesel sold in each Brazilian city. 
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database

Other activities that produce steam as byproduct are excluded, so that consumers of steam get by default supplied with steam produced using the average energy mix that is estimated to be used for steam production in the chemical industry within the geography of this market. 

The production volume is set equal to that of the supplying transforming activity. It is calculated based on data from the IEA, according to which the current ""global energy demand for the chemical industry is 15 EJ per year (EJ/yr) excluding feedstock"" (IEA, 2013). Roughly 40% of the energy is assumed to be delivered in the form of steam, based on data for the United States (JISEA, 2016). The mass of steam is calculated assuming an energy content of steam of 2.75 MJ/kg (Althaus et al., 2007). Furthermore, the production volume of the dataset covering the geography of Europe (RER) has been subtracted, in order to account only for the production of steam occurring in the rest of the world.

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick. If the average compression strength is 3 45 MPa, the brick is ranked as extra strong. The main product of the Swiss industry is brick. It is usually plastered. If it is used for a visible brick wall aesthetic criteria as colour and structure of the surface have to be fulfilled and a good weathering resistance is necessary.",cutoff38,25c9d67c-dbd5-4767-bee9-59fde0c3b50b_e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad.spold,e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad,GLO,market for clay brick,[],1.0,clay brick,[],process,kilogram

Ready Mixed concrete will be made from a mix of cement, aggregates and water. Aggregates make up the majority of the concrete’s volume and the cement provides resistance. Additives will be incorporated into the mix to ensure particular properties such as improved durability or shortened hardening times.

In the designation of concrete mix M refers to the mix and the number to the specified compressive strength of 150 mm size cube at 28 days, expressed in N/mm2.

The determination of the proportion of cement, aggregate and water to attain the required strength shall be made as follows:
(a) By designing the concrete mix: such concrete shall be called ‘Design mix concrete’, for details reference may be made to RCC Chapter.
(b) By adopting nominal concrete mix: such concrete shall be called ‘Nominal mix concrete’.

Design mix concrete is preferred to nominal mix. If design mix concrete cannot be used for any reason on the work for grades of M20 or lower, nominal mixes may be used with the permission of Engineer-in-Charge, which, however, is likely to involve a higher cement content.

The Ready Mixed Concrete will be immediately transported to specified construction site in the radius of 50 to 75 km of proposed RMC unit by concrete mix tankers having rotating drums which will rotate at a speed of two to six rotations per minutes during transportation to maintain the quality of ready mixed concrete.""

This is delivering the service of 'stretch blow moulding'. Stretch blow molding is a special form of blow molding. The process exploits the fact that high degrees of orientation can be introduced in plastics by drawing at temperatures near the glass transition temperature or crystalline melting point. Mechanical properties are considerably improved in this way. In this process, the preform is drawn not only in the circumferential direction (as with extrusion blow molding) but also in the machine direction. The longitudinal drawing is brought about mechanically by using a ram. Because of the relatively low temperature at which this process is carried out, high deformation forces are required (air pressure up to 2 MPa).  In the service of strech blow moulding, 1 kg of this process corresponds to 0.978 kg of strech blow moulded plastic.The converted amount of plastics is not included into the dataset. Thus, this service should be used along with 1 kg of thermoplastic materials, like polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PETP).

Fertilisers are substances that furnish essential nutrients for plant growth, thereby improving the yield and in some cases the quality of plant products. 'Inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N' is a fertiliser with a mineral origin that is supplying the nutrient of Nitrogen to the plants. The product represents an equivalent form of Nitrogen that is present in the fertiliser and is expressed as a mass of Nitrogen (N). 'Inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N'  can  originate from various substances that are synthesised using fossil resources. Those substances can be, ammonia, urea etc, while the fossil resources can be natural gas, hard coal etc.
No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.

In the event that the market is not 100% representative, that data have been normalised based on the available fertilisers in the database. 
This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
Fertilisers are substances that furnish essential nutrients for plant growth, thereby improving the yield and in some cases the quality of plant products. 'Inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N' is a fertiliser with a mineral origin that is supplying the nutrient of Nitrogen to the plants. The product represents an equivalent form of Nitrogen that is present in the fertiliser and is expressed as a mass of Nitrogen (N). 'Inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N'  can  originate from various substances that are synthesised using fossil resources. Those substances can be, ammonia, urea etc, while the fossil resources can be natural gas, hard coal etc.
This is a generic market that provides 'inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N' for a strictly agricultural use as fertiliser. The market combines (consumption mix) various inorganic sources for the nutrient provided for the given geography. Data for the consumption of this nutrient originate from the International Fertiliser Association.
