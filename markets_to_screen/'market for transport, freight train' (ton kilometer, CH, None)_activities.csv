This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on national data and international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6. Crude oil directly imported to the Swiss refinery in Cressier is transported through the Pipeline Oléoduc du Jura Neuchâtelois from the port Fos-sur-Mer close to Marseille in France (Erdöl-Vereinigung 2017). The length of the Pipeline is estimated to 600 km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is the market for  'heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.
The shares of heat supplying activities from the different technologies have been estimated based on IEA statistics (http://www.iea.org/stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=25) for the year 2009. They amount to about 52% heat from coal and peat, 16% heat from oil, 18% heat from biofuels (modelled with biogas and wood), 11% heat from waste and 2% heat from other sources. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not necessarily correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future.
