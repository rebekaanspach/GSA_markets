This market represents this cement type in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point. The National Union of the Cement Industry estimated the average transport distances for cement as 400 km in Southeastearn and Southern regions of the Brazil, but high uncertainty is associated with it, as transportation distances can reach 1000 km in the Northern region (SNIC, 2013a, p.11). The data are considered representative for cement commercialization to construction activities in Brazil. The major part of cement (96 %) is distributed by road, but there is also a share of train and barge transportation (SNIC, 2013b, p.23).

This market represents the gravel for construction in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point. Transport distance from gravel quarries to concrete block industries was used to represent gravel transportation to construction activities in Brazil (average distance 23,8 km). Gravel is a heavy material and as such, transportation distance must be as low as possible so that the product's price remains competitive. Also for this reason, there are no relevant gravel imports.
Lorry sizes were extrapolated from the market for sand/BR dataset, as the transportation activities of both aggregates are similar.

This market represents the clinker for cement in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point (cement factories). Transport distance was estimated by defining the non integrated cement plants in Brazil and identifying the closest clinker source, based on public information and expert opinion, while for integrated plants, transportation distance was set to zero. 24 out of 88 cement production plants in Brazil were assumed to be non integrated. The average transportation distance of these plants is 500 km, but high uncertainty is associated with it. The resulting average transportation distance considering integrated and non-integrated cement plants is 136 km.
We also assumed the same modal distribution for clinker as for cement distribution.Imports of clinker are negligible in Brazil according to the National Union of the Cement Industry.

This market represents this cement type in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point. The National Union of the Cement Industry estimated the average transport distances for cement as 400 km in Southeastearn and Southern regions of the Brazil, but high uncertainty is associated with it, as transportation distances can reach 1000 km in the Northern region (SNIC, 2013a, p.11). The data are considered representative for cement commercialization to construction activities in Brazil. The major part of cement (96 %) is distributed by road, but there is also a share of train and barge transportation (SNIC, 2013b, p.23).
