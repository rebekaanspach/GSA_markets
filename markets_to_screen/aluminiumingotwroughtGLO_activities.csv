Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This dataset describes the electricity available on the medium voltage level for the Chinese primary aluminium-industry, i.e. used for primary aluminium production only. Aluminium industry specific markets are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located.
Geography:  China
Technology:  Average technology used to transmit and distribute electricity. Includes underground and overhead lines, as well as air-, vacuum- and SF6-insulated high-to-medium voltage switching stations.",cutoff-3.9.1,32c43cc2-fb87-5df6-a790-a7e06efa32a6_4fcfb407-7879-42ad-9582-ab3fbfe5af10.spold,4fcfb407-7879-42ad-9582-ab3fbfe5af10,CN,"market for electricity, medium voltage, aluminium industry",[],1.0,"electricity, medium voltage, aluminium industry",[],process,kilowatt hour
