Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area.

This is the market for  'diesel, burned in building machine', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
diesel, burned in building machine' describes the use of a fossil fuel. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from distillation of heavy oil. This exchange provides the service of burning 1 MJ of diesel in a builiding machinery. The services also includes (air) emissions and the production and provision of fuel. 1 MJ equals 0.0234 kg of diesel (LHV of diesel ca 42.8 MJ/kg).",cutoff-3.9.1,79d6450d-f9ad-5619-89c3-05c8d7622af3_b0f4c2fb-5081-474a-8ffa-1457da8345db.spold,b0f4c2fb-5081-474a-8ffa-1457da8345db,GLO,"market for diesel, burned in building machine",[],1.0,"diesel, burned in building machine",[],process,megajoule

[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]
