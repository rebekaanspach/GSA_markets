This is the market for  'fatty acid methyl ester', in the geography of Brazil.
This dataset represents the distribution phase of the Brazilian average mix of vegetable oils and animal fats methyl ester. From the esterification plant, the product is transported to fuel distribution points, where biodiesel may be blended with fossil diesel.
Data obtained under the scope of the National Biofuel Policy (RenovaBio), implemented in 2017 by the Brazilian Federal Government seeking to expand the share of biofuels in the energy mix. On its framework, biofuels producers are subjected to a certification process, which requires Life Cycle Inventory data collection used to calculate the environmental efficiency (climate change category) of its product. The calculations are executed in the RenovaCalc calculator, which defines the system boundaries and contains many predefined indicators to connect with the collected data. Until the present study, 19 biodiesel producers have been certified and their LCI data are used in this dataset for describing the esterification process.
The RenovaCalc calculator, accounts for the distribution phase of biodiesel by using predefined distances based on official and sector data according to the transport mode reported by the producer. The weighted average data reported by the producers reveals that the distribution of biodiesel is done 92% by road transport and 8% by railway. For biodiesel, RenovaCalc considers a distance of 1,500 km (for railway modal, it is considered 900 km by train and 600 by road).
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in: redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database/.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This dataset describes the electricity available on the high voltage level in India, Eastern grid. This is done by showing the transmission of 1kWh electricity at high voltage.
Technology:  Average technology used to transmit and distribute electricity. Includes underground and overhead lines, as well as air-, vacuum- and SF6-insulated high-to-medium voltage switching stations. Electricity production according to related technology datasets. 
Definition of the voltage levels: 
 - High voltage level above 24 kV (large scale industry)
 - Medium voltage level between 1 kV and 24 kV (medium to small scale industry, service sector
and public buildings)
 - Low voltage level below 1 kV (Households)
