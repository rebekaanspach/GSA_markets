'Urea' is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 57-13-6. It is called 'urea' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CH4N2O. It is solid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, 'urea' is used in the following products: fertilisers, cosmetics and personal care products and pH regulators and water treatment products. This substance has an industrial use resulting in manufacture of another substance (use of intermediates). On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, pulp, paper and paper products, textile, leather or fur and mineral products (e.g. plasters, cement). Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (47-0-0).

This market represents the clinker for cement in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point (cement factories). Transport distance was estimated by defining the non integrated cement plants in Brazil and identifying the closest clinker source, based on public information and expert opinion, while for integrated plants, transportation distance was set to zero. 24 out of 88 cement production plants in Brazil were assumed to be non integrated. The average transportation distance of these plants is 500 km, but high uncertainty is associated with it. The resulting average transportation distance considering integrated and non-integrated cement plants is 136 km.
We also assumed the same modal distribution for clinker as for cement distribution.Imports of clinker are negligible in Brazil according to the National Union of the Cement Industry.
EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent 45% of Brazilian road cargo fleet, according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.

The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'quicklime, in pieces, loose', in the geography of Switzerland.
Based on research in the Swiss statistics (Swiss Impex database -> www.swiss-impex.admin.ch) majority of building and construction materials produced in Switzerland are also consumed in Switzerland, that is why the regional market for quicklime, in pieces, loose is created.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime. Quicklime is used for soil stabilisation in the road construction industry, as a building material, as a process material in the chemical and sugar industries, in the iron and steel industry where it is used as an additive for the formation of slag in electric furnaces, and for the treatment of wastewater.",cutoff-3.9.1,add1dfa9-2b45-5648-be73-aec8f6d0fc7c_e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db.spold,e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db,CH,"market for quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],1.0,"quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of China. Besides domestic production, China imported large quanties of natural gas from other countries (mainly from Australia and Turkmenistan) in 2019 (BP 2022). The supply to this market activity, however, only includes domestic production.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This is the market for  'fatty acid methyl ester', in the geography of Brazil.
This dataset represents the distribution phase of the Brazilian average mix of vegetable oils and animal fats methyl ester. From the esterification plant, the product is transported to fuel distribution points, where biodiesel may be blended with fossil diesel.
Data obtained under the scope of the National Biofuel Policy (RenovaBio), implemented in 2017 by the Brazilian Federal Government seeking to expand the share of biofuels in the energy mix. On its framework, biofuels producers are subjected to a certification process, which requires Life Cycle Inventory data collection used to calculate the environmental efficiency (climate change category) of its product. The calculations are executed in the RenovaCalc calculator, which defines the system boundaries and contains many predefined indicators to connect with the collected data. Until the present study, 19 biodiesel producers have been certified and their LCI data are used in this dataset for describing the esterification process.
The RenovaCalc calculator, accounts for the distribution phase of biodiesel by using predefined distances based on official and sector data according to the transport mode reported by the producer. The weighted average data reported by the producers reveals that the distribution of biodiesel is done 92% by road transport and 8% by railway. For biodiesel, RenovaCalc considers a distance of 1,500 km (for railway modal, it is considered 900 km by train and 600 by road).
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in: redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database/.

The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This inventory is based on the BR regional market of refined petroleum product dataset available in ecoinvent version 3.6 (2019), which was created as a copy (with adjusted uncertainty information) of the corresponding datasets for Europe without Switzerland in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017) within the SRI-LCI data collection projects. The original dataset for regional distribution of refined petroleum products was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2, and it was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.
This dataset comprises transportation of product from the refinery to the end-user, operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents. To update with primary data, only the transportation of diesel to the end-user is adapted. For this, it is considered the location of refineries; the amount of diesel imported in each port; the amount and location of diesel deliveries in 78 primary distribution points; and, the amount of diesel sold in each Brazilian city. 
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database 
Geography:  Weighted average distance (ton.km) per transport mode for delivering diesel from production and importing points to the end-user were estimated for the Brazilian market.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Saudi Arabia. Imports to the market for natural gas in Saudi Arabia have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Switzerland. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This dataset represents the refined diesel mix (standard grade) traded and consumed within South Africa. Refined (standard grade) diesel comes from two main sources: crude oil refinery operations in ZA and from imports. A small amount is also exported. Data from SAPIA (South Africa Petroleum Industry Association) report 2016.
South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). The major petroleum products that are sold in South Africa are petrol, diesel, jet fuel, illuminating paraffin, fuel oil, bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), with petrol and diesel as the major liquid fuels that are used in South Africa.
There are six major liquid fuel producing sites in the country - four on the coast and two inland (Fig 1: Source: SAPIA annual report 2016) and refined petroleum products are produced by crude oil refining, by coal-to-liquid (CtL) and gas-to-liquid (GtL) technologies and by natural gas to liquid fuels.
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
""PETROL and DIESEL PRODUCTS SPECIFICATIONS: The current fuel specifications and standards published by DoE are suited to meet Euro 2 fuel standards (Clean Fuels 1). 
Fuels specification and standards are regulated by to the Petroleum Product Act 1977 (Act No. 120 of 1977) revised and updated on 23 June 2006. Petrol permitted grades are: metal-free unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95; metal-containing unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95 and maximum permitted traces of lead of 13 milligrams per litre; petrol with more than 95 RON; petrol with lead additives for use in airplanes with internal combustion engines. Diesel permitted grades are: standard grade diesel (max sulphur content of 500 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v), low-sulphur diesel (max sulphur content of 50 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v); biodiesel 100%.

Geography:  South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very little oil and gas. Liquid fuels, of which about 1/3rd are made synthetically from coal and gas, play a central role in the socio-economic development of the country. 
None
The oil industry is divided into upstream, midstream and downstream activities. Upstream refers to the exploration and production of crude oil. Midstream refers to refining, whilst downstream includes transportation and marketing of end-user products. South Africa has very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). 
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
INDUSTRY ROLE PLAYERS: The major role players in the South African liquid fuels market are government and its associated institutions, as well as SAPIA members. The DoE is responsible for ensuring the secure and sustainable provision of energy for socio-economic development. Through institutions like the CEF and NERSA, the government plays a significant role in the South African liquid fuels market.
MARKET PRICES: Government regulates wholesale margins and controls the retail price of petrol. South African petroleum prices are regulated, based on import parity price formulas. This means that the domestic price is influenced by supply and demand for petroleum products in international markets, combined with the rand/dollar exchange rate

This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an onshore well, for oil or/and gas extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of onshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The drilling activity requires land for both work and disposal. While the work area can be held relatively small at around 0.2 ha, the disposal of drilling waste requires more space. Additional land is used for roads that need to be established as the wells are often located in remote areas. Here, a conversion of 90m2 per meter of drilling depth is expected, and with a 2-month construction period, the use of 15m2a/m.

This market represents this cement type in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point. The National Union of the Cement Industry estimated the average transport distances for cement as 400 km in Southeastearn and Southern regions of the Brazil, but high uncertainty is associated with it, as transportation distances can reach 1000 km in the Northern region (SNIC, 2013a, p.11). The data are considered representative for cement commercialization to construction activities in Brazil. The major part of cement (96 %) is distributed by road, but there is also a share of train and barge transportation (SNIC, 2013b, p.23).
EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent the prevailing Brazilian road cargo fleet (45%), according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.

This activity represent the local (ZA) market for PGMs concentrate as it comes out from platinum mining and concentration operations. It consits of data coming from five different companies, each one consisting of several mining sites for an overall coverage of 74,8% of ZA PGMs production for the year of reference (2015). 
[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: Most of the mining and concentration operations for PGM are in an area called Bushveld Complex. The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals.
The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments.
The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone.
The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance. 
The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium.
The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium. The complex  has its geographic centre  located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs).
Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen.
After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes.
In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots.
At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.

PLATINUM MINIG IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex.
The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output.
Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value.
In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies.
The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

This dataset describes the energy requirements and the emissions of the high pressure distribution network in Japan. This module describes the transport of natural gas from the evaporation plant to the customer. The calculation of the emissions is based on the composition of the natural gas and the yearly losses.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick. If the average compression strength is 3 45 MPa, the brick is ranked as extra strong. The main product of the Swiss industry is brick. It is usually plastered. If it is used for a visible brick wall aesthetic criteria as colour and structure of the surface have to be fulfilled and a good weathering resistance is necessary.",cutoff-3.9.1,10282993-ad4b-5b68-a2bc-7afe8f7b5023_e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad.spold,e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad,GLO,market for clay brick,[],1.0,clay brick,[],process,kilogram

This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an offshore well, for oil or/and gas exploration extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of offshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The offshore drilling activity requires space for both supply and disposal. A temporary area of about 0.2 ha is required for the storage of the roughing, cement and other supplies (chemicals, fuels) for a well of about 3,400 m depth. The drilling time is about 2 months. The stress on the benthos (animal and plant life of the seabed) as a disposal site is assumed for the duration of one year. Thus, per meter drilled, about 260 m2 of seabed is severely impacted. The process includes all energy uses, materials and emissions for drilling of an offshore bore hole and finishing of the well.

This dataset represents the refined diesel mix (low-sulfur) traded and consumed within South Africa (ZA). Refined low-sulfur diesel comes from three main sources: crude oil refinery operations in ZA, from syntethic fuel production in ZA and from imports. A small amount is also exported. Data from SAPIA (South Africa Petroleum Industry Association) report 2016.
South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). The major petroleum products that are sold in South Africa are petrol, diesel, jet fuel, illuminating paraffin, fuel oil, bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), with petrol and diesel as the major liquid fuels that are used in South Africa.
There are six major liquid fuel producing sites in the country - four on the coast and two inland (Fig 1: Source: SAPIA annual report 2016) and refined petroleum products are produced by crude oil refining, by coal-to-liquid (CtL) and gas-to-liquid (GtL) technologies and by natural gas to liquid fuels.
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
""PETROL and DIESEL PRODUCTS SPECIFICATIONS: The current fuel specifications and standards published by DoE are suited to meet Euro 2 fuel standards (Clean Fuels 1). 
Fuels specification and standards are regulated by to the Petroleum Product Act 1977 (Act No. 120 of 1977) revised and updated on 23 June 2006. Petrol permitted grades are: metal-free unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95; metal-containing unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95 and maximum permitted traces of lead of 13 milligrams per litre; petrol with more than 95 RON; petrol with lead additives for use in airplanes with internal combustion engines. Diesel permitted grades are: standard grade diesel (max sulphur content of 500 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v), low-sulphur diesel (max sulphur content of 50 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v); biodiesel 100%. 
Figure 2 and 3 provide the production, consumption and import trends of petrol and diesel respecitvely (Source: Supply, demand and imports – DoE, GDP – South African Reserve Bank (SARB)).""

Geography:  South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very little oil and gas. Liquid fuels, of which about 1/3rd are made synthetically from coal and gas, play a central role in the socio-economic development of the country. The oil industry is divided into upstream, midstream and downstream activities. Upstream refers to the exploration and production of crude oil. Midstream refers to refining, whilst downstream includes transportation and marketing of end-user products. South Africa has very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). 
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
INDUSTRY ROLE PLAYERS: The major role players in the South African liquid fuels market are government and its associated institutions, as well as SAPIA members. The DoE is responsible for ensuring the secure and sustainable provision of energy for socio-economic development. Through institutions like the CEF and NERSA, the government plays a significant role in the South African liquid fuels market.
MARKET PRICES: Government regulates wholesale margins and controls the retail price of petrol. South African petroleum prices are regulated, based on import parity price formulas. This means that the domestic price is influenced by supply and demand for petroleum products in international markets, combined with the rand/dollar exchange rate

This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime. Quicklime is used for soil stabilisation in the road construction industry, as a building material, as a process material in the chemical and sugar industries, in the iron and steel industry where it is used as an additive for the formation of slag in electric furnaces, and for the treatment of wastewater.",cutoff-3.9.1,9d6ec0e1-3acb-5ec4-9264-691cf8e279e5_e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db.spold,e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db,RoW,"market for quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],1.0,"quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on national data and international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6. Crude oil directly imported to the Swiss refinery in Cressier is transported through the Pipeline Oléoduc du Jura Neuchâtelois from the port Fos-sur-Mer close to Marseille in France (Erdöl-Vereinigung 2017). The length of the Pipeline is estimated to 600 km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This market represents the gravel for construction in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point. Transport distance from gravel quarries to concrete block industries was used to represent gravel transportation to construction activities in Brazil (average distance 23,8 km). Gravel is a heavy material and as such, transportation distance must be as low as possible so that the product's price remains competitive. Also for this reason, there are no relevant gravel imports.
Lorry sizes were extrapolated from the market for sand/BR dataset, as the transportation activities of both aggregates are similar.
EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent the prevailing Brazilian road cargo fleet (45%), according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Algeria. Imports to the market for natural gas in Algeria have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.
