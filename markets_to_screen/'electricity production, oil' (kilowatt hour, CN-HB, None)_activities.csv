This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Region of North America.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an onshore well, for oil or/and gas extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of onshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The drilling activity requires land for both work and disposal. While the work area can be held relatively small at around 0.2 ha, the disposal of drilling waste requires more space. Additional land is used for roads that need to be established as the wells are often located in remote areas. Here, a conversion of 90m2 per meter of drilling depth is expected, and with a 2-month construction period, the use of 15m2a/m. The process includes all energy uses, materials and emissions for drilling of an offshore bore hole and finishing of the well.
