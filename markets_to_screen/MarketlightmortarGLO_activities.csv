This is the market for  'limestone, crushed, for mill', in the Global geography.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""limestone, crushed, for mill"" represents a naturally occurring mineral that consists principally of calcium carbonate but may also contain magnesium carbonate as a secondary component. It is found in many forms and is classified in terms of its origin, chemical composition, structure, and geological formation. Limestone occurs widely throughout the world and is an essential raw material for many industries. Limestone is generally used for construction, cement, quicklime, agriculture, metal refining and flue gas desulphurisation: Construction: Limestone is the most widely used crushed rock, although it is generally sold in form of sand and gravel. Cement: The production of cement is the main use for chalk, and a major use for dense, high-calcium limestone. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime. Agriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of limestone. Metal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag. Flue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of limestone is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.",cutoff-3.9.1,02cc2f48-7a34-5ffd-b499-26b3fb19f379_6dff6412-4b37-4689-8187-f07be186feef.spold,6dff6412-4b37-4689-8187-f07be186feef,RoW,"market for limestone, crushed, for mill",[],1.0,"limestone, crushed, for mill",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is the market for  'lime', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""lime"" represents 1 kg of quicklime. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime. Agriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of lime. Metal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag. Flue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of lime is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.",cutoff-3.9.1,65a8257d-b074-51b9-b451-37d97288ef39_a00b7e35-1bc7-4b73-9df8-05f3dd07ffdb.spold,a00b7e35-1bc7-4b73-9df8-05f3dd07ffdb,RoW,market for lime,[],1.0,lime,[],process,kilogram

This dataset represents the global market for uncoated particle board. Particleboard, or particle board (or chipboard in the UK and Commonwealth Nations such as Australia, New Zealand and others), is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, saw-mill shavings, or saw dust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Particleboard is a composite material according to the standard EN 312. The density of stan-dard particleboard can vary between 650 – 750 kg/m3, whereas densities for low density particle-board can be as low as 250 kg/m3 and range up to 1300 kg/m3 for high density particleboard. Typical thickness is in a range of 3 to > 40 mm. Uncoated particle board represent the weighted average of particle boards produced by the members of the European Panel Federation (EPF).
Seven types of boards are classified and are distinguished as follows (EN 312):P1 General purpose boards for use in dry conditions, P2 Boards for interior fitments (including furniture) for use in dry conditions, P3 Non load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P4 Load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P5 Load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P6 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P7 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions. Particleboard is mainly used in furniture manufacturing. 
Particleboard can also be used for structural applications. Different types of speciality boards can be produced according to individual building application requirements; moisture resistance, fire retardance or acoustic insulation are all properties which can be achieved by using specific types of particleboard. Particleboard can also be used for construction purposes in combination with other materials, for example in parquet or insulation materials.

This dataset represents the refined diesel mix (low-sulfur) traded and consumed within South Africa (ZA). Refined low-sulfur diesel comes from three main sources: crude oil refinery operations in ZA, from syntethic fuel production in ZA and from imports. A small amount is also exported. Data from SAPIA (South Africa Petroleum Industry Association) report 2016.
South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). The major petroleum products that are sold in South Africa are petrol, diesel, jet fuel, illuminating paraffin, fuel oil, bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), with petrol and diesel as the major liquid fuels that are used in South Africa.
There are six major liquid fuel producing sites in the country - four on the coast and two inland (Fig 1: Source: SAPIA annual report 2016) and refined petroleum products are produced by crude oil refining, by coal-to-liquid (CtL) and gas-to-liquid (GtL) technologies and by natural gas to liquid fuels.
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
""PETROL and DIESEL PRODUCTS SPECIFICATIONS: The current fuel specifications and standards published by DoE are suited to meet Euro 2 fuel standards (Clean Fuels 1). 
Fuels specification and standards are regulated by to the Petroleum Product Act 1977 (Act No. 120 of 1977) revised and updated on 23 June 2006. Petrol permitted grades are: metal-free unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95; metal-containing unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95 and maximum permitted traces of lead of 13 milligrams per litre; petrol with more than 95 RON; petrol with lead additives for use in airplanes with internal combustion engines. Diesel permitted grades are: standard grade diesel (max sulphur content of 500 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v), low-sulphur diesel (max sulphur content of 50 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v); biodiesel 100%. 
Figure 2 and 3 provide the production, consumption and import trends of petrol and diesel respecitvely (Source: Supply, demand and imports – DoE, GDP – South African Reserve Bank (SARB)).""

Geography:  South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very little oil and gas. Liquid fuels, of which about 1/3rd are made synthetically from coal and gas, play a central role in the socio-economic development of the country. The oil industry is divided into upstream, midstream and downstream activities. Upstream refers to the exploration and production of crude oil. Midstream refers to refining, whilst downstream includes transportation and marketing of end-user products. South Africa has very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). 
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
INDUSTRY ROLE PLAYERS: The major role players in the South African liquid fuels market are government and its associated institutions, as well as SAPIA members. The DoE is responsible for ensuring the secure and sustainable provision of energy for socio-economic development. Through institutions like the CEF and NERSA, the government plays a significant role in the South African liquid fuels market.
MARKET PRICES: Government regulates wholesale margins and controls the retail price of petrol. South African petroleum prices are regulated, based on import parity price formulas. This means that the domestic price is influenced by supply and demand for petroleum products in international markets, combined with the rand/dollar exchange rate

This dataset represents the transport of linerboard from the mill to corrugated board box production sites. Linerboard id commonly not traded globally but rather on regional/local markets. This datasets was therefore introduced for the supply of regions which lack local production and markets of corrugated board boxes. Transport distances and modes were estimated based on the ecoinvent default transport assumptions. The estimated amount of transport via transoceanic ship was neglected, because intercontinental trade is not common for this type of product. Losses are assumed negligible for this type of product.
Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.
