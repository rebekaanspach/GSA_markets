This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Russian Federation. Imports to the market for natural gas in Russian Federation have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'polyvinylfluoride, film', in the Global geography.
In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.
'polyvinylfluoride, film', is a plastic product of fossil origin, it is not biodegradable and it is a thermoplastic material. This product consists of 100% virgin material with no content of recycled material. The product is used in the following applications and sectors: Poly(vinyl fluoride) films are laminated to sheets of metal with special adhesives. The laminates are used for exterior siding on industrial and residential buildings. Pigmented films can be made in any colour .  These films made from PVF have exceptional resistance to sunlight, chemical attack, and water adsorption. They are also extremely tough and have good abrasion resistance. Films can also be laminated to hardboard, paper, polystyrene, polyurethane, and other substrates. These laminates are used for wall coverings, aircraft cabin interiors, pipe covering, duct liners, as well as other applications. A weather-resistant PVF barrier is also resistant to abrasion, chemicals, solvents, and staining. Another application for PVF film is as a release sheeting in the molding of phenolic, epoxide, and polyester plastics, and as a release film for bag molding. It does not become brittle and strips easily from the mold. Toughness is maintained at elevated temperatures at all degrees of humidity and in contact with common solvents. The film has been used for photovoltaic applications because of its high transparency and resistance to solar radiation.",cutoff-3.9.1,13185c4b-ee9f-536c-b9a4-6fb678a576d4_6534b875-82f0-4714-b31e-58214929b0a9.spold,6534b875-82f0-4714-b31e-58214929b0a9,GLO,"market for polyvinylfluoride, film",[],1.0,"polyvinylfluoride, film",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'heat, district or industrial, natural gas', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.
The shares of heat supplying activities from combined heat and power (CHP) plants and pure heat plants have been estimated based on OECD statistics (OECD (2013)) for the year 2009. They amount to about 70% heat from combined heat and power plants and 30% heat from pure heat plants. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Global. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.
