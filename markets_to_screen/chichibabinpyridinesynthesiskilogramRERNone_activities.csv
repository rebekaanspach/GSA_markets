They also account for transport (distribution) to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Global. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

acetaldehyde'  is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000075-07-0. It is called 'acetaldehyde' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C2H4O. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and has a pungent odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level.
