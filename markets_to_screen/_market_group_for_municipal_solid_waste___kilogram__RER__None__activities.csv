This is the market for  'heat, district or industrial, natural gas', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.
The shares of heat supplying activities from combined heat and power (CHP) plants and pure heat plants have been estimated based on OECD statistics (OECD (2013)) for the year 2009. They amount to about 70% heat from combined heat and power plants and 30% heat from pure heat plants. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future.

This market dataset models the disposal mix for 1 kg of municipal solid waste in Germany using country-specific data. The mix is composed by the following technologies: 0% of open burning, 1% of sanitary landfill, 99% of municipal incineration. Values are rounded without decimals.

The transport from the production site of the waste to the different treatment facilities where the waste is treated is accounted here.
