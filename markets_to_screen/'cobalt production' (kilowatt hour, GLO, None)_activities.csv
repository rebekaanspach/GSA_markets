This is the market for  'transport, freight, lorry >32 metric ton, EURO4', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is delivering the service of transportation of 1 metric ton across the distance of 1 km. This service only considers the transportation of goods. The vehicle operates with diesel, its emission standard is classified as EURO4 and it falls under the lorry size class of  >32 metric tons. The average freight load factor of a >32 metric ton lorry is 15.96 tonnes, with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 29.96 tonnes. It has a lifetime capacity of 540,000 km as heavy commercial vehicle.
