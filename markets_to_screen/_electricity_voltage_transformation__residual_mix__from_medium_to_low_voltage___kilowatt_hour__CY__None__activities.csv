The product ""clinker"" represents Portland cement clinker, also known as cement clinker or just clinker. Crystallised calcium silicates that are rich in calcium oxide and can rapidly react with the mixing water make up at least two-thirds of the commercial portland cement clinker. The cement industry uses limestone, marl and clay for producing clinker. Therefore the raw material mixture is calcined in a rotary kiln. Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime.",cutoff-3.9.1,14f5286e-08c4-5e66-a395-259bd004379d_1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538.spold,1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538,RoW,market for clinker,[],1.0,clinker,[],process,kilogram

This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an offshore well, for oil or/and gas exploration extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of offshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The offshore drilling activity requires space for both supply and disposal. A temporary area of about 0.2 ha is required for the storage of the roughing, cement and other supplies (chemicals, fuels) for a well of about 3,400 m depth. The drilling time is about 2 months. The stress on the benthos (animal and plant life of the seabed) as a disposal site is assumed for the duration of one year. Thus, per meter drilled, about 260 m2 of seabed is severely impacted.
