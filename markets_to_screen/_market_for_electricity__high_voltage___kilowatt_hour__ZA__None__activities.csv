This dataset describes the electricity available on the medium voltage level for the Chinese primary aluminium-industry, i.e. used for primary aluminium production only. Aluminium industry specific markets are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located.

This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''calcium nitrate'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Global. 
If 1 kg of this 'calcium nitrate' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.171 kg of Nitrogen as N.
The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Calcium nitrate' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 10124-37-5. It is called 'calcium dinitrate' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: Ca1N2O6. It is solid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, 'calcium nitrate' is used in the following products: anti-freeze products, fertilisers, cosmetics and personal care products, washing & cleaning products, water treatment chemicals, adhesives and sealants, pH regulators and water treatment products, coating products, metal surface treatment products, non-metal-surface treatment products and metal working fluids. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: mining, building & construction work and agriculture, forestry and fishing. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (17-0-0) +0.24 Ca.

This dataset describes the average transport for the consumption of South African thermal coal, both for domestic consumption and for export. The market includes domestic coal sold on the open market (accounting for 37% of domestic coal sales, 26% of which are to Eskom for power generation), coal directly supplied to power stations via converyors from tied collieries (38% of domestic coal sales) and coal used by SASOL in their own operations for production of synthetic fuels and chemicals (22% of domestic coal sales). The remaining 3% of domestic sales is of metallurgical coal. The dataset also covers 35% of South Africa's coal exports (representing exports to countries other than India and Europe, as these are covered by their own market datasets). As such this market process is comprised of 87% domestic sales and 13% export sales and accounts for the sale of 210 million tonnes in 2014 (domestic and export sales extracted from DMR (2015a).

This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in China. In China coal is transported mainly by railway (60%), water (30%), and road (10%). Two major transport corridors are distinguished: the North–south coal traffic accounting for 75% and the east–west coal traffic accounting for 25% of the total coal transported (Wang and Ducruet, 2014).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.
Geography:  Transport distances are geography specific, losses and related emissions are generic values applicable worldwide.
Technology:  Not specified",cutoff-3.9.1,7f6ec89c-a6e9-5632-a963-3a22cf2eb66a_0d3eda5a-4601-4573-9549-0701c459ab88.spold,0d3eda5a-4601-4573-9549-0701c459ab88,CN,market for hard coal,[],1.0,hard coal,[],process,kilogram
