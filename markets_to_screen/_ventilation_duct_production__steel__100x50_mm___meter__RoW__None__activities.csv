This is delivering the service of 'sheet rolling, steel'. For the applications that the products of hot rolling are unsatisfactory, e.g., with respect to cross section, surface quality, dimensional accuracy, and general finish, this service can be used. It is based on cold rolling while the end product has high quality surface finish and precise metallurgical properties for use in high specification purposes. This service is to be used only for un- and low-alloyed steel. The metal input is not included in this dataset. Thus, this service should be used along with 1 kg of steel.
