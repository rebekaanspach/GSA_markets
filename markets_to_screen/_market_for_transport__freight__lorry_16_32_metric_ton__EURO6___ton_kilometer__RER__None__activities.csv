This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is the market for  'offshore well, oil/gas', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an offshore well, for oil or/and gas exploration extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of offshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The offshore drilling activity requires space for both supply and disposal. A temporary area of about 0.2 ha is required for the storage of the roughing, cement and other supplies (chemicals, fuels) for a well of about 3,400 m depth. The drilling time is about 2 months. The stress on the benthos (animal and plant life of the seabed) as a disposal site is assumed for the duration of one year. Thus, per meter drilled, about 260 m2 of seabed is severely impacted. The process includes all energy uses, materials and emissions for drilling of an offshore bore hole and finishing of the well.

This is the market for  'hard coal, run-of-mine', in the geography of India.
The activity represents transport of hard coal, run of mine to various users in the country. Average Transport distance specific for the country has been used. Handling and Transit Losses has been used in the dataset.   
The major modes of transport of coal in India are Railways, Road (use of lorries), Merry Go Round Systems (MGR), Belt or Pipe Conveyor. The majority of the coal transportation is handled by Railways which contributes to almost 52 % of the overall coal transport in india. Coal transported through road is around 26 % while merry go round system contributes around 18.48 %. Belt conveyor contributes to around 1.55 % of overall transportation.In this activity Railaway and MGR are combined into one because of their similar systems.
The transport distance for the datasets are calculated by using online maps by finding approximate distance between dispatch points and users. The quantity of coal being despatched from each mine to various users was published by Coal India Limited in their online app "" Coal Sewa"".

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime.

This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an onshore well, for oil or/and gas extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of onshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The drilling activity requires land for both work and disposal. While the work area can be held relatively small at around 0.2 ha, the disposal of drilling waste requires more space. Additional land is used for roads that need to be established as the wells are often located in remote areas. Here, a conversion of 90m2 per meter of drilling depth is expected, and with a 2-month construction period, the use of 15m2a/m.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on national data and international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6. Crude oil directly imported to the Swiss refinery in Cressier is transported through the Pipeline Oléoduc du Jura Neuchâtelois from the port Fos-sur-Mer close to Marseille in France (Erdöl-Vereinigung 2017). The length of the Pipeline is estimated to 600 km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.
