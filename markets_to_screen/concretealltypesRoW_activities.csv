Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for  'concrete, 25MPa', in the Global geography.
In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.
The product ""concrete, 25MPa"" represents  25 MPa ready-mix concrete. The raw materials for 1 mÂ³ include: Cement 279 kg, Water 166 kg, Gravel 1010 kg, Sand 955 kg, Fly ash 21 kg, Water reducing admixture 0,9 kg. 25 MPa concrete is intended for interior slabs not exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses.",cutoff-3.9.1,413444d3-da63-5e4c-a5d1-b9424d92e8a9_3fdbecc2-bb86-4c4b-8f5c-7b80e5e365c8.spold,3fdbecc2-bb86-4c4b-8f5c-7b80e5e365c8,RoW,"market for concrete, 25MPa",[],1.0,"concrete, 25MPa",[],process,cubic meter
