This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of China.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in China. In China coal is transported mainly by railway (60%), water (30%), and road (10%). Two major transport corridors are distinguished: the North–south coal traffic accounting for 75% and the east–west coal traffic accounting for 25% of the total coal transported (Wang and Ducruet, 2014).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This is the market for  'clinker', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clinker"" represents Portland cement clinker, also known as cement clinker or just clinker. Crystallised calcium silicates that are rich in calcium oxide and can rapidly react with the mixing water make up at least two-thirds of the commercial portland cement clinker. The cement industry uses limestone, marl and clay for producing clinker. Therefore the raw material mixture is calcined in a rotary kiln. Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime.",cutoff-3.9.1,14f5286e-08c4-5e66-a395-259bd004379d_1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538.spold,1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538,RoW,market for clinker,[],1.0,clinker,[],process,kilogram
