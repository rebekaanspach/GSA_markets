This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of China.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in China. In China coal is transported mainly by railway (60%), water (30%), and road (10%). Two major transport corridors are distinguished: the North–south coal traffic accounting for 75% and the east–west coal traffic accounting for 25% of the total coal transported (Wang and Ducruet, 2014).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This dataset describes the electricity available on the high voltage level in SERC Reliability Corporation. This is done by showing the transmission of 1kWh electricity at high voltage.
Technology:  Average technology used to transmit and distribute electricity. Includes underground and overhead lines, as well as air-, vacuum- and SF6-insulated high-to-medium voltage switching stations. Electricity production according to related technology datasets. 
Definition of the voltage levels: 
 - High voltage level above 24 kV (large scale industry)
 - Medium voltage level between 1 kV and 24 kV (medium to small scale industry, service sector
and public buildings)
 - Low voltage level below 1 kV (Households)
