Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''ammonia, anhydrous, liquid'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Europe. 
If 1 kg of this 'ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.822 kg of Nitrogen as N.
The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file 'Default Transport Assumptions' at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).
'Ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 7664-41-7. It is called 'ammonia' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H3N. It is gaseous in normal conditions of temperature and pressure and has a distinct pungent odor. On a consumer level, 'ammonia, anhydrous, liquid' is used in the following products: cosmetics and personal care products, heat transfer fluids, washing & cleaning products and coating products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, textile, leather or fur, pulp, paper and paper products, plastic products and fabricated metal products. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (82-0-0).
