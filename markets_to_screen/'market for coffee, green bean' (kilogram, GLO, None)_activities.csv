This is the market for  'coffee, green bean', in the Global geography.
In this market, default transport model and expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.
The default transport distances are built on a generic model which assigns the transport distances based on the ISIC code. This approach is, especially in case of fruits and vegetables, rather coarse. So in a certain cases expert judgement is used to adjust the default distances.
None
The transport distances and associated impacts presented in the markets represents the average scenario for given geography. In case of fruits and vegetables the final impact at the consumer vary a lot depending on whether the food is consumed near the producer or far. The average impact of, for example, banana is overestimated if the consumer is present in Brazil and it is heavily underestimated is the consumer is present in Europe. The markets are modelled so, that editing to model concrete scenario is possible and easy.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for  'ammonia, anhydrous, liquid', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
ammonia, anhydrous, liquid'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007664-41-7. It is called 'azane' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: NH3. It is gas under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and has a distinct pungent odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: cosmetics and personal care products, heat transfer fluids, washing & cleaning products and coating products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, textile, leather or fur, pulp, paper and paper products, plastic products and fabricated metal products. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (82-0-0).",cutoff-3.9.1,58c7b066-abed-5c76-86e7-297f2533a0b7_06b8d05b-e1e6-427b-929c-bb55e84e7c08.spold,06b8d05b-e1e6-427b-929c-bb55e84e7c08,RoW,"market for ammonia, anhydrous, liquid",[],1.0,"ammonia, anhydrous, liquid",[],process,kilogram
