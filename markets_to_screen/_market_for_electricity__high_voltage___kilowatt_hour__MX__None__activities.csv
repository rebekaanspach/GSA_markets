This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Northern America.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in North America (US and Canada). All inland transportation modes are used for coal shipments in this region. In the US, which is the dominating coal market in North America, about 70% of coal is transported by rail, about 10% by barges on inland waterways, 10% by truck and 10% by conveyor belts to reach its destination of use or exporting ports (Association of American Railroads, 2017). Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage are estimated based on literature.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

This is the market for  'quicklime, in pieces, loose', in the Global geography.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime. Quicklime is used for soil stabilisation in the road construction industry, as a building material, as a process material in the chemical and sugar industries, in the iron and steel industry where it is used as an additive for the formation of slag in electric furnaces, and for the treatment of wastewater.",cutoff-3.9.1,9d6ec0e1-3acb-5ec4-9264-691cf8e279e5_e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db.spold,e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db,RoW,"market for quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],1.0,"quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],process,kilogram

This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.
