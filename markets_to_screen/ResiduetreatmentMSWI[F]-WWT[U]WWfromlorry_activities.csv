Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg.

This is the market for  'limestone, crushed, for mill', in the geography of Switzerland.

Based on Swiss Impex database (www.swiss-impex.admin.ch, accessed 20160119, cathegory; 2521 - Limestone flux; limestone and other calcareous stone, of a kind used for the manufacture of lime or cement) there was 5E+7 kg of limestone imported to Switzerland in 2014.

Limestone occurs widely throughout the world and is an essential raw material for many industries. Limestone is generally used for construction, cement, quicklime, agriculture, metal refining and flue gas desulphurisation: Construction: Limestone is the most widely used crushed rock, although it is generally sold in form of sand and gravel. Cement: The production of cement is the main use for chalk, and a major use for dense, high-calcium limestone. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime. Agriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of limestone. Metal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag. Flue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of limestone is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.",cutoff-3.9.1,102c38b5-9504-529f-96e3-71483ba4a6d1_6dff6412-4b37-4689-8187-f07be186feef.spold,6dff6412-4b37-4689-8187-f07be186feef,CH,"market for limestone, crushed, for mill",[],1.0,"limestone, crushed, for mill",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

The product ""lime"" represents 1 kg of quicklime. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime. Agriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of lime. Metal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag. Flue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of lime is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.

This is the market for  'clay', in the geography of Switzerland.
Basic construction materials produced in Switzerland are generally also consumed in Switzerland. That is why the regional Swiss market is created. 
The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).
Clay sediments are used in great variety, with the primary raw materials being loams, clays, marls, mudstone, shale, and slate together with smaller quantities of boulder clay, loess, and sand. They can contain all types of suitable clay minerals (layered silicates), such as illite, sericite, kaolinite, chlorite, and montmorillonite. The composition and particle size are the two principal factors that determine the nature of this product. The main component of the raw material clay is Kaolin. Kaolin approaches the formula of the mineral kaolinite (Al2O3.2SiO2.2H2O). Kaolins are primary clays formed by local decomposition of feldspar mineral.  Clay is mainly used for producing bricks. Other products with a porous structure are produced from raw materials including clay, e.g., face bricks, paving bricks, roofing tiles, drainage pipes, and cable conduits. Clinker, with its impervious or nearly impervious structure is produced mainly from shale and stoneware clays.",cutoff-3.9.1,ff135314-19df-5ecd-8fbd-85073152215c_e89b4064-afcc-4f08-9481-651b7eaa90a1.spold,e89b4064-afcc-4f08-9481-651b7eaa90a1,CH,market for clay,[],1.0,clay,[],process,kilogram

Limestone is generally used for construction, cement, quicklime, agriculture, metal refining and flue gas desulphurisation In construction, limestone is the most widely used crushed rock, although it is generally sold in form of sand and gravel. Cement: The production of cement is the main use for chalk, and a major use for dense, high-calcium limestone. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime.",cutoff-3.9.1,7656d468-90c4-583c-8fc9-064ba11f9426_cf8c95e1-aa88-4d23-9d83-065a935387d3.spold,cf8c95e1-aa88-4d23-9d83-065a935387d3,CH,"market for limestone, unprocessed",[],1.0,"limestone, unprocessed",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'transport, freight, sea, tanker for petroleum', in the Global geography.
This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.
This is delivering the service of transportation of 1 metric ton across the distance of 1 km. This service only considers the transportation of liquid goods by a tanker for petroleum. The ship operates with heavy fuel oil and has a mass of 7,774,400 kg. The DWT (load capacity) of the container ship is 36,000 tonnes, and it is estimated to transport an average of 4,100 million tonne.kms per year for 25 years.  The transport node indirectly considers empty trips (if any) by taking into account the total amount of freight transported throughout the lifetime of the mobile infrastructure.",cutoff-3.9.1,ddc06bf6-1393-5423-bb93-1b1a7eb292f1_774bc814-70cf-4389-8bf8-e6435174c72e.spold,774bc814-70cf-4389-8bf8-e6435174c72e,GLO,"market for transport, freight, sea, tanker for petroleum",[],1.0,"transport, freight, sea, tanker for petroleum",[],process,ton kilometer

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Region of North America.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.
