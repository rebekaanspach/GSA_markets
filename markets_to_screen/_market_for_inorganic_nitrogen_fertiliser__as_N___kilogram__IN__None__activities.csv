Fertilisers are substances that furnish essential nutrients for plant growth, thereby improving the yield and in some cases the quality of plant products. 'Inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N' is a fertiliser with a mineral origin that is supplying the nutrient of Nitrogen to the plants. The product represents an equivalent form of Nitrogen that is present in the fertiliser and is expressed as a mass of Nitrogen (N). 'Inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N'  can  originate from various substances that are synthesised using fossil resources. Those substances can be, ammonia, urea etc, while the fossil resources can be natural gas, hard coal etc.

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Global. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP (2020).It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.
