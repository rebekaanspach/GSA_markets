This dataset describes the electricity available on the high voltage level for the Chinese primary aluminium-industry, i.e. used for primary aluminium production. Aluminium industry specific markets are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located.

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

Besides domestic production, China imported large quanties of natural gas from other countries (mainly from Australia and Turkmenistan) in 2019 (BP 2022). The supply to this market activity, however, only includes domestic production.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.

This is the market for  'clay brick', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clay brick"" represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. Ordinary bricks constitute the largest fraction of total brick production. They have a porous body. If there are no special requirements with regard to appearance or resistance to weathering, they are called inner-wall bricks, or backing bricks, and can be solid or hollow. For hollow bricks there are requirements for compression strength (4 - 28 MPa) and brick bulk density of 1.0 -2.2 kg/dm3. (The brick bulk density is calculated by dividing the mass of the dried brick by its volume including all channels, finger holes, and mortar pockets, or frogs.) One special variety of brick is the insulating brick used to reduce heat flow. For these the strength specification is between 2 and 28 MPa. The brick density must be only between 0.6 and 1.0 kg/dm3. Adding materials that burn during firing increases the porosity. Insulating brick can be as large as 49 × 30 × 23.8 cm. Progress is being made in producing room high building components. These are known as brick planks and are produced as monolithic pieces with an extrusion press. If the brick has surface and colour suitable for facing and it is able to withstand frost, the brick is classified as face brick, or facing brick. If the average compression strength is 3 45 MPa, the brick is ranked as extra strong. The main product of the Swiss industry is brick. It is usually plastered. If it is used for a visible brick wall aesthetic criteria as colour and structure of the surface have to be fulfilled and a good weathering resistance is necessary.",cutoff-3.9.1,10282993-ad4b-5b68-a2bc-7afe8f7b5023_e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad.spold,e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad,GLO,market for clay brick,[],1.0,clay brick,[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'quicklime, in pieces, loose', in the Global geography.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime. Quicklime is used for soil stabilisation in the road construction industry, as a building material, as a process material in the chemical and sugar industries, in the iron and steel industry where it is used as an additive for the formation of slag in electric furnaces, and for the treatment of wastewater.",cutoff-3.9.1,9d6ec0e1-3acb-5ec4-9264-691cf8e279e5_e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db.spold,e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db,RoW,"market for quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],1.0,"quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Venezuela. Imports to the market for natural gas in Venezuela have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.
