This dataset represents the global market for bleached sulfate market pulp. Tranports are modelled with the ecoinvent default transport model.
PULP is a clean, wood-based, renewable and biodegradable raw material to make different paper, board and other products. Depending on its application, bleached or unbleached pulp is required. Here, Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleached kraft pulp
 are covered. 
It is further distinguished between integrated pulp, which is further processed into pulp based products such as papers within the same production site, and market pulp which is internationally traded. Therefore only market pulp is covered in this dataset.

Crude Tall Oil (CTO) is a viscous and odorous liquid of yellow to black color. It is obtained as a byproduct in the production of wood pulp from the kraft pulping process. It is not independently produced, which means its supply depends on the production of kraft pulp.
None
Its name is derived from the Swedish word for pine tree, “tall”, indicating that CTO is mostly produced in the pulping of softwood trees, such as pines. The kraft pulping process of generates a byproduct called black liquor, which contains valuable chemicals. To recover these chemicals and feed them back into the process, first the so called Crude Sulphate Soap (CSS) is removed. CSS can then either be burned as internal fuel or further processed into Crude Tall Oil. The latter processing is often viable, given the multiple applications of CTO:
None
• distillation into valuable products (about 80% of CTO)
• production of renewable diesel (about 13% of CTO)
• component of petroleum drilling fluids (about 5% of CTO)
• process fuel in pulp mills (about 1% of CTO)
None
Tall oil consists of free C18 unsaturated fatty acids, resin acids and relatively small amounts of unsaponifiables. The fatty acid fraction of tall oil contains mainly oleic acid, linoleic acid and its isomers. Tall oil fatty acids are easily converted into their methyl esters by reaction with methanol in the presence of sulphuric acid, whereas the resin acids are virtually unesterified.
None
