This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Algeria. Imports to the market for natural gas in Algeria have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

The product ""clinker"" represents Portland cement clinker, also known as cement clinker or just clinker. Crystallised calcium silicates that are rich in calcium oxide and can rapidly react with the mixing water make up at least two-thirds of the commercial portland cement clinker. The cement industry uses limestone, marl and clay for producing clinker. Therefore the raw material mixture is calcined in a rotary kiln. Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime.",cutoff-3.9.1,14f5286e-08c4-5e66-a395-259bd004379d_1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538.spold,1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538,RoW,market for clinker,[],1.0,clinker,[],process,kilogram

Imports to the market for natural gas in the United Arab Emirates have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.
