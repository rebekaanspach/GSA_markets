Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.
This is the market for 'concrete, normal', in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.
No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.
The product ""concrete, normal"" represents a generic dataset that was created to facilitate users who do not have specific information about the type of concrete. In the ecoinvent database, for all geographies outside Switzerland, concrete, normal represents concrete with strengths between 20 and 35MPa. In the case of Switzerland, concrete, normal represents B35/25 (based on SIA 162), which is between C20/25 and C25/30, based on SIA 262.",cutoff-3.9.1,61d4bc8e-9cdd-51e0-b76f-e0a6377892ca_eee95138-58c8-4172-9b1f-754ba074325d.spold,eee95138-58c8-4172-9b1f-754ba074325d,RoW,"market for concrete, normal strength",[],1.0,"concrete, normal strength",[],process,cubic meter
