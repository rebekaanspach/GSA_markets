This dataset describes the energy requirements and the emissions of the high pressure distribution network in Japan. This module describes the transport of natural gas from the evaporation plant to the customer. The calculation of the emissions is based on the composition of the natural gas and the yearly losses.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'quicklime, in pieces, loose', in the geography of Switzerland.
Based on research in the Swiss statistics (Swiss Impex database -> www.swiss-impex.admin.ch) majority of building and construction materials produced in Switzerland are also consumed in Switzerland, that is why the regional market for quicklime, in pieces, loose is created.
This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.
The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime. Quicklime is used for soil stabilisation in the road construction industry, as a building material, as a process material in the chemical and sugar industries, in the iron and steel industry where it is used as an additive for the formation of slag in electric furnaces, and for the treatment of wastewater.",cutoff-3.9.1,add1dfa9-2b45-5648-be73-aec8f6d0fc7c_e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db.spold,e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db,CH,"market for quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],1.0,"quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Northern America.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in North America (US and Canada). All inland transportation modes are used for coal shipments in this region. In the US, which is the dominating coal market in North America, about 70% of coal is transported by rail, about 10% by barges on inland waterways, 10% by truck and 10% by conveyor belts to reach its destination of use or exporting ports (Association of American Railroads, 2017). Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage are estimated based on literature.

This is the market for  'hard coal, run-of-mine', in the geography of India.
The activity represents transport of hard coal, run of mine to various users in the country. Average Transport distance specific for the country has been used. Handling and Transit Losses has been used in the dataset.   
The major modes of transport of coal in India are Railways, Road (use of lorries), Merry Go Round Systems (MGR), Belt or Pipe Conveyor. The majority of the coal transportation is handled by Railways which contributes to almost 52 % of the overall coal transport in india. Coal transported through road is around 26 % while merry go round system contributes around 18.48 %. Belt conveyor contributes to around 1.55 % of overall transportation.In this activity Railaway and MGR are combined into one because of their similar systems.
The transport distance for the datasets are calculated by using online maps by finding approximate distance between dispatch points and users. The quantity of coal being despatched from each mine to various users was published by Coal India Limited in their online app "" Coal Sewa"".

This dataset represents the refined diesel mix (standard grade) traded and consumed within South Africa. Refined (standard grade) diesel comes from two main sources: crude oil refinery operations in ZA and from imports. A small amount is also exported. Data from SAPIA (South Africa Petroleum Industry Association) report 2016.
South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). The major petroleum products that are sold in South Africa are petrol, diesel, jet fuel, illuminating paraffin, fuel oil, bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), with petrol and diesel as the major liquid fuels that are used in South Africa.
There are six major liquid fuel producing sites in the country - four on the coast and two inland (Fig 1: Source: SAPIA annual report 2016) and refined petroleum products are produced by crude oil refining, by coal-to-liquid (CtL) and gas-to-liquid (GtL) technologies and by natural gas to liquid fuels.
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
""PETROL and DIESEL PRODUCTS SPECIFICATIONS: The current fuel specifications and standards published by DoE are suited to meet Euro 2 fuel standards (Clean Fuels 1). 
Fuels specification and standards are regulated by to the Petroleum Product Act 1977 (Act No. 120 of 1977) revised and updated on 23 June 2006. Petrol permitted grades are: metal-free unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95; metal-containing unleaded petrol with minimum RON rating 91, 93 or 95 and maximum permitted traces of lead of 13 milligrams per litre; petrol with more than 95 RON; petrol with lead additives for use in airplanes with internal combustion engines. Diesel permitted grades are: standard grade diesel (max sulphur content of 500 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v), low-sulphur diesel (max sulphur content of 50 mg/kg and biodiesel content ranging from 5 to 50% v/v); biodiesel 100%. 
Figure 2 and 3 provide the production, consumption and import trends of petrol and diesel respecitvely (Source: Supply, demand and imports – DoE, GDP – South African Reserve Bank (SARB)).""

Geography:  South Africa (SA) is a country with abundant coal and renewable energy resources, but very little oil and gas. Liquid fuels, of which about 1/3rd are made synthetically from coal and gas, play a central role in the socio-economic development of the country. 
None
The oil industry is divided into upstream, midstream and downstream activities. Upstream refers to the exploration and production of crude oil. Midstream refers to refining, whilst downstream includes transportation and marketing of end-user products. South Africa has very limited crude oil reserves of its own and about 60% of its crude oil requirements are met by imports from the Middle East and Africa (Source: South Africa Yearbook 2012/2013). 
DISTRIBUTION: Petroleum products are moved from refineries by pipelines, rail, sea and road to approximately 200 depots, 4 600 service stations and 100 000 direct consumers who are mostly farmers.
INDUSTRY ROLE PLAYERS: The major role players in the South African liquid fuels market are government and its associated institutions, as well as SAPIA members. The DoE is responsible for ensuring the secure and sustainable provision of energy for socio-economic development. Through institutions like the CEF and NERSA, the government plays a significant role in the South African liquid fuels market.
MARKET PRICES: Government regulates wholesale margins and controls the retail price of petrol. South African petroleum prices are regulated, based on import parity price formulas. This means that the domestic price is influenced by supply and demand for petroleum products in international markets, combined with the rand/dollar exchange rate

This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure"" [m3], in the geography of Russian Federation. Imports to the market for natural gas in Russian Federation have not been considered, and this activity is hence supplied with gas from domestic production only.It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.
The product ‘natural gas, high pressure"" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2022). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.

This is the market for  'clinker', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
The product ""clinker"" represents Portland cement clinker, also known as cement clinker or just clinker. Crystallised calcium silicates that are rich in calcium oxide and can rapidly react with the mixing water make up at least two-thirds of the commercial portland cement clinker. The cement industry uses limestone, marl and clay for producing clinker. Therefore the raw material mixture is calcined in a rotary kiln. Clinker is then used as an important component for the production of cement. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime.",cutoff-3.9.1,14f5286e-08c4-5e66-a395-259bd004379d_1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538.spold,1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538,RoW,market for clinker,[],1.0,clinker,[],process,kilogram

This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of Russia.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in Russia. Russia holds the world’s third-largest recoverable coal reserves (after the US and China) and was the sixth-largest coal producer in 2016. About 80% of the country’s production is steam coal, about 20% coking coal. The main mining area is located in the Kuzbass basin in Central Russia. About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. (The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets.) The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This is the market for crude ‘petroleum"" oil [kg], in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2019. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2022, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6: For most European countries, distances for transport of crude oil from import to refineries are assumed to be on average about 100km in onshore pipelines. Exceptions are, e.g., transport from Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan to Europe. There, transport is assumed to be done completely in onshore pipelines which therefore are considerably longer. For countries with smaller production rates like the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom, it is assumed that the whole production is refined locally. The distance for transport in a local onshore pipeline is therefore set to a generic value of 10km.Crude ""petroleum"" oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.

The product ""quicklime, in pieces, loose"" represents the production of 1 kg of quicklime in pieces, obtained by calcination of crushed limestone. Quicklime is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone. It consists mainly of calcium oxide. Its quality depends on many factors, including physical properties, degree of sintering and chemical composition. As the most readily available and cost effective alkali, quicklime plays an essential part in a wide variety of industrial processes. The difference between clinker and quicklime used for products in the binding agent industry is mainly the calcination temperature which is a maximum of 1’450ºC for clinker and a maximum of 1’200ºC for quicklime. This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime. Quicklime is used for soil stabilisation in the road construction industry, as a building material, as a process material in the chemical and sugar industries, in the iron and steel industry where it is used as an additive for the formation of slag in electric furnaces, and for the treatment of wastewater.",cutoff-3.9.1,9d6ec0e1-3acb-5ec4-9264-691cf8e279e5_e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db.spold,e79575a7-0b20-46d5-94b2-99d1916105db,RoW,"market for quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],1.0,"quicklime, in pieces, loose",[],process,kilogram

This inventory is based on the BR regional market of refined petroleum product dataset available in ecoinvent version 3.6 (2019), which was created as a copy (with adjusted uncertainty information) of the corresponding datasets for Europe without Switzerland in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017) within the SRI-LCI data collection projects. The original dataset for regional distribution of refined petroleum products was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2, and it was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.
This dataset comprises transportation of product from the refinery to the end-user, operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents. To update with primary data, only the transportation of diesel to the end-user is adapted. For this, it is considered the location of refineries; the amount of diesel imported in each port; the amount and location of diesel deliveries in 78 primary distribution points; and, the amount of diesel sold in each Brazilian city. 
This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database

This is the market for  'hot rolling, steel', in the Global geography.
Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.
This is delivering the service of 'hot rolling, steel'. Hot-rolling refers to a mill process in which the steel is rolled at a temperature above its recrystallization temperature with a heat that typically exceeds 1000° F. The hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it, lengthen it, reduce the cross-sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness. Then the steel is cooled at room temperature.The service includes input materials, energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and waste treatment, but it excludes the input of steel to be rolled. Hot-rolled steel typically has a scaly surface finish and it suitable for structural components and other applications where incredibly precise shapes and tolerances are of less importance like railroad tracks, I-beams, agricultural equipment, sheet metal and automotive frames.
