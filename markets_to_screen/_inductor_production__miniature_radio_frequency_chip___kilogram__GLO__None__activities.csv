This is the market for  'hard coal', in the geography of China.
This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in China. In China coal is transported mainly by railway (60%), water (30%), and road (10%). Two major transport corridors are distinguished: the North–south coal traffic accounting for 75% and the east–west coal traffic accounting for 25% of the total coal transported (Wang and Ducruet, 2014).
Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.

This dataset is a copy of the South African dataset, but it is also used as the best available representation of the GLO situation of the sector as well. 
This activity represent the local (ZA) market for unrefined gold as it comes out from both gold mining operation and gold unrefined production and treatment of sulfidic tailing, off-site, high gold content. It consits of data coming from five different companies, each one consisting of several mining sites for an overall coverage of 79,3% of ZA gold production for the year of reference (2015). Shares between treatment of sulfidic tailing and gold mining and unrefined gold production are: 6.3% (recovered from retreatment) and 73% (produced from mining operation).
The refinement of gold takes place at Rand Refinery (Pty) Limited that is the largest integrated single-site preciuos metal refining and smelting complex in the world. Rand Refinery is the refining hub for Africa and increasingly beyond.
Geography:  None
This dataset is a copy of the South African dataset, but it is also used as the best available representation of the GLO situation of the sector as well. Transport is either via road (predominantly in South Africa) or via air and sea freight. Share of the different tecnologies were taken from the ecoivent transport template (2013/07/22).
Most of the mining operation and unrefined gold production activities are in an area called Witwatersrand basin. The are is approximately 350 km long and 200 km wide. the gold mines in this area are possiblu the deepest in the world (mining operation at 3600 m  and explortion core-drilling up to 4600 m. Peak gold production occurred in 1970 when over 1000 metinc tonnes were mined.
